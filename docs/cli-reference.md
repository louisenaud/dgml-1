# `dgml` CLI Reference

The `dgml` CLI is designed for both humans and LLM-agent consumption.
Output is JSON by default; errors are structured envelopes; commands are
flag-driven (no interactive prompts) and idempotent where reasonable.

## Conventions

- **stdout** carries the success payload as a JSON object.
- **stderr** carries error envelopes:
  ```json
  { "error": { "code": "FILE_NOT_FOUND", "message": "..." } }
  ```
- Exit codes:
  - `0` — success
  - `1` — error (anything in the `error` envelope)
  - `2` — `dgml check` ran but found issues

`--format text` switches to a basic key/value text format if a human is
driving the CLI directly.

**Boolean flags** follow one convention: a positive `--flag` (e.g.
`--recursive`, `--force`, `--skip-existing`) turns on a behavior that is
**off by default**; a `--no-*` flag (e.g. `docset generate`'s
`--no-coverage`) opts **out** of a step that is **on by default**. So
`--no-*` appears only where the default is "do it"; everything else is
opt-in. `--auto-classify` is the one opt-in flag that also accepts an
optional value to pick *which* variant of the behavior to run — see
"Auto-classification".

A complete list of error `code` values is in the [Error code
reference](#error-code-reference) at the end of this document.

## Global flags

These parse in **any position** — before the subcommand
(`dgml --format text file list`), after it (`dgml file list --format text`),
or after a command group (`dgml docset --format text list`).

| Flag             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `--workspace`    | Override the workspace to open — a filesystem path **or** a workspace id from `dgml workspace list`. An id is 3 to 40 characters using only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores, starting with a letter or digit (`my-workspace`, or a generated `ws_…`), so it can also be a directory name; the two are told apart by **looking**: a value the store of workspaces holds is that workspace, an existing directory of that name is a path, and a value that is neither fails with `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND` rather than being treated as a path to create. A listed id wins over a same-named directory — address the directory as `./name`. Anything carrying a separator, a dot or an uppercase letter is always a path. Default: `$DGML_HOME` (also either form) then `./dgml-workspace`. |
| `--workspace-config` | **Removed.** Still accepted so an existing caller gets a JSON error envelope instead of an argparse usage dump; passing it (or setting `$DGML_CONFIG`) fails with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` naming the replacement. It only ever worked as an address because the per-machine index recorded the location and handed it back on the next open. To start a workspace from a config you authored, use `dgml workspace create --from-config <path>`. |
| `--format`       | `json` (default) or `text`. |
| `--verbose`      | Emit informational diagnostics to stderr. Controls hybrid text-mode warnings (digital/OCR conflicts, OCR misses) and the per-page merge summary, plus the `docset generate` pipeline's progress lines. Off by default — stderr stays reserved for error envelopes. |
| `--debug`        | Keep intermediate debug files in the workspace **and** record LLM cost/token telemetry to `<workspace>/usage.jsonl`. Off by default, so only final files (and the small functional cache the next run reloads) are kept. With `--debug` off: no `usage.jsonl` rows are written for **any** operation (classify, cluster, transcribe, label, links, schema/value extraction, hybrid merge); `docset generate` skips the debug-only `cache/` artifacts (raw LLM dumps, `*.concept.xml`/`*.semantic.xml`, prompt listings) and `coverage_report.json`; and the in-place grounding pass skips the `<stem>.dgml.grounding_stats.json` sidecar. The functional `cache/` files (`*_blocks.json`, `label_*_cNN_raw.json`, `concept_roster.json`) are **always** written — incremental generation reloads them. Pass `--debug` to retain the debug artifacts and log usage. (Coverage summaries still print on stderr under `--verbose` either way.) |

## Workspace commands

### `dgml init [--provider PROVIDER] [--force]`
Establish the **user-level config** — nothing else. `init` writes the
user-level config with a `[models]` block, choosing its location in this order:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dgml/config.toml` when `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set;
- otherwise `%APPDATA%\dgml\config.toml` on Windows;
- otherwise `~/.config/dgml/config.toml`.

It does **not** create `docsets/`, `files/`, or any workspace config — that is
`dgml workspace create`. Configure once per machine; every workspace inherits
this config (see [storage-layout.md](storage-layout.md) for the full resolution
order).

The `[models]` block names four tiers — `light`, `standard`, `advanced`,
`expert` — that back the per-task models (classification/style, transcription/
text-extraction, labeling/value-extraction, schema-generation respectively).

- **`--provider {anthropic,google,mixed,openai}`:** write that provider's
  default `[models]` table. Omit to **auto-detect** from the API-key env vars
  that are set: both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `GEMINI_API_KEY` → `mixed`; either
  one alone → that provider; `OPENAI_API_KEY` alone → `openai`. Only presence is
  checked, not validity. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is checked **last**, so adding it to a
  machine never changes what the other two keys already detected — pass
  `--provider openai` to choose OpenAI where several keys are present. With no
  keys, a commented-out `[models]` placeholder is written. (A provider with no
  curated table — Azure OpenAI, Bedrock, a self-hosted endpoint — is still
  usable by setting an explicit `<provider>/<model>` per tier or per task.)
- **`--force`:** overwrite an existing `config.toml` (backing it up to
  `config.toml.bak` first). Without `--force`, a present file is **never**
  clobbered — a re-run with `--provider` but no `--force` is a no-op whose
  `next_action` tells you to pass `--force`.

Output (JSON):

```json
{
  "config_path": "~/.config/dgml/config.toml",
  "config_created": true,
  "provider": "mixed",
  "detected_keys": ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "GEMINI_API_KEY"],
  "forced": false,
  "next_action": "dgml workspace create --organization <org>"
}
```

The human-readable report (detected keys, the `[models]` block with inline
tier→capability comments, next steps) goes to **stderr**; stdout stays the JSON
contract. `provider` is `null` when no keys were detected.

### `dgml workspace create [PATH] --organization ORG [--name NAME] [--id WORKSPACE_ID] [--storage NAME] [--from-config PATH]`

**Where the workspace goes depends on whether you name a place for it.**

- **No `PATH`, no global `--workspace`, no `$DGML_HOME`** → the workspace is created in
  [the store of workspaces](storage-layout.md#the-store-of-workspaces): its root becomes
  `~/dgml-workspaces/<workspace_id>/` on the local-disk default, its config is written
  there, and it is listed by `dgml workspace list` and openable as
  `--workspace <workspace_id>` from any directory. This is the default, and a change in
  behavior — it used to create `./dgml-workspace` relative to the current directory.
  It says nothing about where the workspace's *data* goes; that is whatever `[storage]`
  names.
- **`PATH` given** (`dgml workspace create ./ws …`), or the root resolved from
  `--workspace` / `$DGML_HOME` → a **detached** workspace in that directory, exactly as
  before. It is addressed by path and is not listed.

Steps:
1. Writes the workspace's own `config.toml` — the `[storage.<service>]` binding it will
   resolve from, plus a machine-managed `[workspace]` identity block (`workspace_id`,
   `name`, `organization`, `storage_service`, `storage_fingerprint`, `created_at`) —
   to whichever of the two places above applies. This happens **first**: everything
   after it is built through the backend that config names.
2. Creates `docsets/` and `files/` on that storage service.
3. Writes the workspace identity (`name` + `organization` + the generated stable
   `workspace_id`) to `workspace.json`, through the store.

Re-running is safe: an existing `[storage.<service>]` is never overwritten, and the
recorded `workspace_id`, `name` and `created_at` are reused rather than regenerated.

Note one consequence of the config *being* the record: for a listed workspace it must
exist before any store can be built, so it can no longer be written last. An
interrupted `create` therefore leaves a workspace that is listed but not finished.
Re-running the same `create` finishes it: the command is idempotent, and an unsealed
workspace opens fine, so there is nothing to clean up first.

The **user-level** config (`~/.config/dgml/config.toml`) is owned by `dgml init` —
`workspace create` does not create or touch it. If it is **absent**, the workspace is
still created (the command never blocks) and a warning is printed to **stderr**
telling you to run `dgml init` and set your API key.

`--organization` is **required for a new workspace** and optional once the workspace's
`config.toml` records one — so re-running `create`, or adopting an existing workspace on
another machine, does not make you retype it. Omitting it with nothing to inherit from
fails with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

It is embedded in this workspace's docset namespace URIs
(`http://dgml.io/<organization>/<DocSetSlug>`) — pick a stable identifier for your org,
as changing it later shifts the namespaces of newly generated XML. Passing a value that
differs from the recorded one **re-organizes the workspace** and prints a warning to
stderr: the change applies to newly generated XML only, so a typo would otherwise split
the corpus across two namespaces with nothing to flag it later.

`--name` is optional human-readable identity metadata; it likewise falls back to the
recorded name, then to the workspace directory name.

`--id WORKSPACE_ID` sets the workspace's stable handle instead of generating one — useful
when the id is decided elsewhere (a tenant id, a fixture, an IaC template) or when a
workspace is being re-created deterministically. It must be **3 to 40 characters using
only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores, and starting with a letter or
digit** — the id is what `--workspace` addresses the workspace by and the folder name the
local store of workspaces gives it, so it has to be a safe, unambiguous path segment.
Anything else fails with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. No `ws_` prefix is required:
`--id my-workspace` is as valid as the generated `ws_…` form.

Three rules keep it from doing damage, all checked **before** anything is written, so a
rejected `--id` never leaves a half-built workspace behind:

- An id this machine's store of workspaces already holds fails with `CONFLICT`. It is
  never an overwrite — the store's write is an upsert, so proceeding would replace that
  workspace's config (and its `[storage]` binding) while its corpus stayed where it was.
- An `--id` matching the id the workspace already has is a **no-op**, so `create` stays
  safe to re-run.
- An `--id` that *differs* from the id the workspace already has fails with
  `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. An id is how every other record refers to a workspace, so `create`
  never re-identifies an existing one.

`--storage NAME` selects the **storage service** the workspace is created on — a
`[storage.<name>]` template in your user-level `config.toml` (see
[storage-layout.md](storage-layout.md)). It is **materialized into the workspace's
own `config.toml`**, which becomes the authoritative record of where the workspace's
data lives. Omit `--storage` for the bundled local-disk default. A `--storage NAME`
that names no configured service fails with `STORAGE_CONFIG_INVALID` before anything
is created.

`--from-config PATH` starts the workspace from a `config.toml` you authored: its
contents are copied **verbatim**, comments included, into the config the workspace owns.
It is a **template, not an adopted file** — the source is not tracked, and later edits to
it have no effect on the workspace. A `[workspaces]` table in it is rejected rather than
ignored: that table selects the store of workspaces, is read only from the user config,
and would be silently inert here.

`--storage` **composes with** `--from-config`: that flag supplies a config to start
from, `--storage` says *which* `[storage.<name>]` table in it to bind to.

If the seed declares services but not the one selected, `create` fails with
`INVALID_ARGUMENT` naming what the file does declare. It does **not** fall back to the
local default: a config passed explicitly exists to name a backend, and silently
building the workspace on local disk instead is only discovered once the data appears
to be missing.

Output (JSON):

```json
{
  "workspace": "…/dgml-workspaces/ws_qf7imkc7f6oqzfwt",
  "workspace_id": "ws_qf7imkc7f6oqzfwt",
  "name": "Acme Contracts",
  "organization": "Acme",
  "storage_service": "default",
  "initialized": true,
  "workspace_config_path": "…/dgml-workspaces/ws_qf7imkc7f6oqzfwt/config.toml",
  "config_location": "…/dgml-workspaces/ws_qf7imkc7f6oqzfwt/config.toml",
  "listed": true,
  "storage_fingerprint": "sha256:…",
  "config_path": "~/.config/dgml/config.toml",
  "config_present": true
}
```

`workspace_config_path` is the workspace's own config **as a filesystem path**, and is
`null` for a listed workspace — whose config may not be a file at all. `config_location`
always names where that config lives, as a path or as `<store>/<workspace_id>`, and is
what error messages quote. `listed` says which of the two kinds of workspace this is.
`config_path`/`config_present` refer to the **user-level** config.

`workspace_id` is the stable handle for this workspace — generated (`ws_` + 16 base32
chars) unless `--id` supplied one; pass it to any command as `--workspace
<workspace_id>`. It survives a directory rename, is written to `workspace.json`, and is
how the store of workspaces keys it. `config_present` reports whether the user-level config exists. When it
is `false`, an extra `next_action` field is present and the stderr warning above
is emitted — but the workspace is created regardless (exit `0`).

### `dgml workspace list`
List the workspaces held in [the store of workspaces](storage-layout.md#the-store-of-workspaces).
With the local-disk default that is per-machine; with a shared backend two machines see
one list. Opens no storage backend, so it works when a workspace's own blob store is
unreachable.

A **detached** workspace — one addressed by path — is not in the store of workspaces and
so is not listed. `dgml workspace import` adds one.

Every field is derived from each workspace's own config, so a row cannot disagree with
the workspace it describes.

Output (JSON), sorted by id:

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    {
      "workspace_id": "ws_7qxdm2pjk3n5rwts",
      "name": "Acme Contracts",
      "organization": "Acme",
      "storage_service": "default",
      "root": "/Users/me/dgml-workspaces/ws_7qxdm2pjk3n5rwts",
      "created_at": "2026-08-05T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "workspaces_store": "/Users/me/dgml-workspaces"
}
```

The index is a **regenerable cache**: it records where workspaces are, not how they
store data. Deleting it loses only enumeration — each workspace is re-added, with its
id intact, the next time it is opened by path. Opening a workspace that has **moved**
corrects its recorded `root` automatically.

### `dgml workspace import [PATH…] [--move] [--dry-run] [--on-conflict skip|fail|replace]`
Add existing workspaces to [the store of workspaces](storage-layout.md#the-store-of-workspaces).

With `PATH`s, imports those directories. **With no arguments**, sweeps every workspace
listed in the legacy `~/.config/dgml/workspaces.json` — the migration path off the old
per-machine index. Nothing happens automatically: adopting a machine's existing
workspaces is a decision, so it is a command.

**Data never moves by default.** A workspace on local disk keeps its directory, recorded
as `workspace_path` in its own `[storage.<service>]` table. That does **not** re-seal it:
`workspace_path` is excluded from the storage fingerprint, because a workspace that has
not moved is the same workspace on the same backend. `--move` relocates the directory
under the store of workspaces instead, and is opt-in because relocating a corpus of page images is not
something to do on the caller's behalf.

**A missing `config.toml` is reconstructed.** If the legacy row carries an inline
`storage` snapshot, that backend is written back — it is a record of where the data
already is. If nothing recorded a binding at all (a workspace older than the index
carrying one, or one whose config was deleted) local disk is assumed, because that is the
only backend such a workspace could have used, and because in the deleted-config case the
real binding is unrecoverable anyway — refusing would preserve nothing. The assumption is
reported as `assumed_local_storage` in the row, on stderr, and in a banner comment in the
config itself; if the data was in fact remote, edit `[storage]` and run `workspace
reseal`.

Two things are still refused, because neither can be reconstructed:

- **No workspace identity** — no `[workspace] workspace_id`, no `workspace.json`, and no
  legacy row. A directory that merely has `docsets/` and `files/` in it is not a
  workspace; generating an id would adopt an arbitrary directory as one.
- **A malformed `workspace_id`** — anything that is not 3 to 40 characters using only
  lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores, starting with a letter or digit.
  Such an id addresses nothing: the local backend filters its folders by that same test,
  so the workspace would be written where `workspace list` never looks and
  `--workspace <id>` never resolves. dgml's generator only emits
  well-formed ids, so this is a hand-edited value; the failure names both places to
  correct it.

`--on-conflict` decides what happens when the store already holds that id: `skip`
(default), `fail`, or `replace` the stored config. The legacy index is left in place, so
import is re-runnable and a half-finished sweep can simply be repeated.

Exit `0` when everything imported, `2` on partial success — one dead directory in an old
index must not strand every other workspace in it.

Output (JSON):

```json
{
  "workspaces_store": "/Users/me/dgml-workspaces",
  "imported": [
    {
      "root": "/Users/me/acme-ws",
      "workspace_id": "ws_7qxdm2pjk3n5rwts",
      "moved": false,
      "workspace_path_recorded": true,
      "config_location": "/Users/me/dgml-workspaces/ws_7qxdm2pjk3n5rwts/config.toml",
      "status": "imported"
    }
  ],
  "skipped": [],
  "failed": [],
  "dry_run": false,
  "source": "~/.config/dgml/workspaces.json",
  "source_removed": false
}
```

`source` and `source_removed` appear only for a legacy sweep. `status` is `imported`,
`would-import` (under `--dry-run`), `skipped` or `failed`; a skipped or failed row
carries a `reason`.

### `dgml workspace reseal [PATH|WORKSPACE_ID] [--check]`
Accept a change to a workspace's `[storage]` configuration: recompute its
`storage_fingerprint` from the currently-resolved backends and record it in the
workspace's `config.toml`. `PATH` is optional and defaults to the globally-resolved
workspace; the workspace must already be initialized (else
`WORKSPACE_NOT_INITIALIZED`).

This is the repair for `STORAGE_BACKEND_MISMATCH`. The usual sequence is: edit
`[storage]` in the workspace's `config.toml`, then reseal.

⚠️ Resealing tells dgml the new configuration is correct — it does **not** move any
data. If the workspace already holds files, migrate them to the new backend first, or
you will be pointing an existing workspace at an empty store.

`--check` compares without writing and exits `1` with the `STORAGE_BACKEND_MISMATCH`
envelope when the storage has drifted — for CI and agents that want to detect the
condition without consenting to it.

Output (JSON):

```json
{
  "workspace": "/Users/me/acme-ws",
  "workspace_id": "ws_7f3k9q2m4b8xr5wa",
  "config_path": "/Users/me/acme-ws/config.toml",
  "storage": {
    "blobs": { "provider": "dgml_storage_s3:S3BlobStore" },
    "docs": { "provider": "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoDocStore" }
  },
  "storage_fingerprint": "sha256:…",
  "previous_fingerprint": "sha256:…",
  "resealed": true
}
```

`previous_fingerprint` is `null` for a workspace that was not yet sealed; `resealed`
is `false` under `--check`.

### `dgml workspace register` — **removed**
Indexing is now automatic: any command that opens a workspace adds it to this
machine's index and corrects its recorded `root` if the directory moved. To change a
workspace's storage backend, edit `[storage]` in its `config.toml` and run
`dgml workspace reseal` — `register --storage` is gone.

For one release the subcommand still parses and returns an `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
envelope naming the replacement, rather than an argparse usage dump.

### `dgml status`
Summary: workspace path, count of docsets, count of files.

### `dgml check [--retry-errors]`
Walk the workspace and report inconsistencies. Issue kinds emitted today:

| Kind | Target | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `missing_metadata` | file/docset | `file.json` or `docset.json` missing (or missing required field like `original_filename`) |
| `corrupt_metadata` | file/docset | `file.json`/`docset.json` exists but is not valid JSON |
| `missing_pdf` | file | The PDF named in `file.json` is missing from the file directory |
| `hash_mismatch` | file | Stored sha256 doesn't match current PDF bytes |
| `pdf_unreadable` | file | pypdf can't parse the PDF (records a permanent error so the next check skips re-parsing) |
| `pdf_unreadable_permanent` | file | A previous parse recorded a permanent failure; not retried without `--retry-errors` |
| `page_count_mismatch` | file | `page_images/` has the wrong number of PNGs (`repaired: true` if rerendered successfully) |
| `page_render_failed` | file | the configured page renderer failed during rerender |
| `page_render_failed_permanent` | file | A previous render recorded a permanent failure; not retried without `--retry-errors` |
| `page_text_count_mismatch` | file | `page_text/` has the wrong number of per-page JSONs (`repaired: true` if re-extracted successfully) |
| `page_text_corrupt` | file | A `page_text/page_N.json` exists but is not valid JSON / missing required fields |
| `text_extraction_failed` | file | pdfminer.six failed to extract any words (records a permanent error so future checks skip retry) |
| `text_extraction_failed_permanent` | file | A previous extraction recorded a permanent failure; not retried without `--retry-errors` |
| `dangling_file_reference` | docset | DocSet references a File ID that doesn't exist |
| `computed_field_unattributed` | docset | A `dg:origin="computed"` element in a file's DGML XML has no `dg:href` sources — the derivation can't be audited (spec §13 requires computed fields to name their sources) |
| `semlink_dangling_href` | docset | A semantic link's `dg:href` names an `xml:id` no element in the document carries |
| `semlink_nested` | docset | A semantic link points at the subject's own ancestor or descendant, stating a relationship the tree's nesting already states. Newly generated files can't carry one — re-generating clears it |

`--retry-errors` clears recorded permanent errors and re-attempts the
failed operations.

### `dgml cluster [--skip-existing] [--config PRESET|PATH] [--mode auto|fresh|incremental] [--method auto|embedding|llm] [--small-corpus-threshold N]`

Requires the `clustering` extra — `uv sync --extra clustering` from a repo
checkout (`pip install dgml[clustering]` once DGML is published to PyPI).
The extra pulls in the
`dgml-clustering` workspace package and its ML stack (embedding models,
`leidenalg`, `scipy`, `sklearn`); without it the
command exits 1 with `MISSING_EXTRA`.

`--skip-existing` makes the command a no-op when **every** file is already
assigned to a DocSet — the clusterer is not run and the payload comes back
with `skipped: true` (and empty `clusters`/`failed_file_ids`).
Use it to make resume/re-run loops cheap. Without the flag (or when at least
one file is still unassigned) the command clusters as normal and reports
`skipped: false`.

`--config PRESET|PATH` selects the clustering configuration for this run. It is
unrelated to the removed global `--workspace-config`, which pointed at the workspace's own
`config.toml`.
It is either a **bundled preset name** — `small` (CPU-only tf-idf + Leiden, no
UMAP; for tiny corpora), `light` (CPU-only tf-idf + Leiden/UMAP; the default),
`medium` (tf-idf text fused with a 2B vision encoder, large CPU / Apple MPS),
or `heavy` (8B vision encoder alone + Leiden/UMAP, GPU) — or a **path** to a
standalone clustering config JSON. The JSON holds the same fields as the
`clustering` section of `<workspace>/config.toml` (`encoder_text`,
`encoder_image`, `fusion`, `manifold`, `training`, `scenario`); it is
deep-merged over the bundled defaults exactly like the workspace section, and
**replaces** that section for this run (the two are not combined). An unknown
preset name, or a path that doesn't exist / isn't valid JSON / isn't a JSON
object, exits 1 with `CLUSTERING_CONFIG_INVALID`. Use it to A/B configs without
editing `config.toml`, or to move up the CPU → MPS → GPU tiers on a specific
run.

`--mode auto|fresh|incremental` selects fresh vs incremental clustering
(default `auto`):

- `fresh` — cluster all unassigned files from scratch into emergent clusters
  (scenario S1), ignoring any existing DocSets as prototypes.
- `incremental` — the "S3" workflow: grow an **existing** clustering. Each
  existing DocSet becomes a category whose prototype is reconstructed from
  *all* of its already-assigned members' embeddings (few-shot S3). New files
  are assigned to the nearest existing DocSet when they fit; the rest form
  emergent `unknown_N` clusters that are LLM-named into new DocSets. Forcing
  this mode on a workspace with no DocSets exits 1 with
  `INCREMENTAL_WITHOUT_CLUSTERS`.
- `auto` — resolves to `incremental` when the workspace already has DocSets,
  else `fresh`.

`--method auto|embedding|llm` selects *how* documents are grouped, orthogonal
to `--mode` (default `auto`):

- `auto` — on a **fresh** run, route to `llm` when at most
  `--small-corpus-threshold` files are clusterable, else `embedding`. An
  **incremental** run always takes `embedding`, whatever the batch size: it
  scores each document against prototypes rebuilt from DocSet members that
  already exist, so two new files are assigned as reliably as two hundred and
  the size of the batch says nothing about whether the statistics hold. The
  default, because neither engine covers every fresh corpus size on its own:
  below the threshold the neighbor graph connects every document to every
  other and the batch comes back as one group, and a corpus of one or two
  files gives the tf-idf fit no document-frequency signal at all.
- `embedding` — force the statistical pipeline (encode → project → cluster)
  described below. The right choice once a corpus is large enough for tf-idf /
  neighbor statistics to be meaningful. On a very small corpus it still runs,
  but tends to return a single group: measured on an internal corpus, 3 to 6
  files come back as one cluster whatever they contain.
- `llm` — force sending **every** document's rendered first pages to the vision
  LLM in a single call and letting it partition them by document type. Built for
  **very small corpora**, where the embedding pipeline has too little signal to
  cluster reliably (tf-idf has almost nothing to weight, k-NN graphs are
  dominated by noise). The model partitions *and* names emergent groups in the
  one call, so no second per-cluster naming round-trip is needed. `--config` is
  ignored on this path (there is no embedding pipeline to configure).

`--small-corpus-threshold N` (default `8`) is the cutoff `--method auto` uses on
a fresh run: corpora of at most `N` clusterable files go to the LLM partitioner,
larger ones to the embedding pipeline. Ignored for `--method embedding` /
`--method llm`, and for incremental runs.

Both `--method llm` and `--method auto` (when it routes to the LLM) require the
same `classification` config as `--auto-classify` (see "Auto-classification"
above) — the LLM partitioner *is* the classifier's vision machinery. With
`--method llm` a missing or malformed `classification` section is an error
(`CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG_MISSING` / `CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG_INVALID`), and a
*runtime* failure — provider down, model rejected — soft-fails instead: every
clusterable file lands in `failed_file_ids`. Under `--method auto` the routing, not the caller,
picked that engine, so a partitioner it cannot use does not fail the run. A
missing `classification` section, a malformed one, or a credential the config
names but the environment does not hold, all group the corpus with the embedding
pipeline instead. The last two also warn, since a config that was written and
cannot be used is a mistake worth reporting. A call that fails once started does
the same, because some of those failures are the partitioner's own and the
embedding pipeline can still name the corpus. The `method` field of the result
says which engine ran.

One case is out of reach of that check: a workspace that leaves its API key to
the provider's own environment variable, as `dgml init` sets up, looks usable
until the call is made. There the run reports `method` as `llm` with every file
in `failed_file_ids`, the same as a pinned `--method llm` run.

`--config` is ignored on the LLM path but still validated there, so a mistyped
preset name or config path is an error under every method — on any run that
reaches the clusterer at all. A run with nothing to cluster returns before the
config is read. The LLM path caps a single call at 24 files; any
beyond that are reported in `failed_file_ids` so you can fall back to the
embedding pipeline for larger corpora.

Cluster files not currently assigned to any DocSet, and **assign each
clustered file to a DocSet**. Runs in two passes:

1. Files whose cluster name matches an existing DocSet are assigned to
   that DocSet immediately.
2. Files whose cluster doesn't match are grouped by cluster name; for
   each unmatched cluster the vision LLM is sent up to
   `MAX_FILES_PER_CLUSTER_NAMING` files and asked to propose
   a `(name, description)` for a fresh DocSet. The DocSet is created and
   every file in that cluster is assigned to it.

Partial success is the contract: if classification config is missing/
invalid, or the LLM call for a given cluster fails, the files in that
cluster fall into `failed_file_ids`. Every other cluster (matched or
successfully named) is still assigned. The command always exits `0`.

```json
{
  "clusters": {
    "k7q3xb91pmrf": "Contracts",
    "abc123def456": "Receipts",
    "xyz789": "unknown_1"
  },
  "failed_file_ids": ["xyz789"],
  "skipped": false,
  "mode": "incremental",
  "n_assigned_existing": 2,
  "n_new_clusters": 1,
  "assignments": {
    "k7q3xb91pmrf": {

    }
  },

}
```

The first three fields are the core contract. The remaining
fields are **additive** (optional — consumers can ignore them) and describe
the incremental workflow:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `clusters` | Map from file id to the DocSet name the file ended up in. Either an existing DocSet's name (the algorithm matched the file to it) or the LLM-proposed name for a newly-created DocSet. A file whose cluster was found but whose *naming* failed keeps its algorithmic placeholder label (e.g. `"unknown_1"`) here *and* appears in `failed_file_ids`. A file that was never in a cluster at all — no page image, or the clusterer placed it nowhere — is **absent from this map** and appears only in `failed_file_ids`, so don't assume `clusters` covers every file in the workspace. |
| `failed_file_ids` | Files that ended up in no DocSet: their cluster needed LLM naming and that naming failed (missing config, no page images, provider error, …), their first page never rendered, or the clusterer put them in no cluster at all. Re-run after fixing the underlying cause; assignments are idempotent. |
| `skipped` | `true` only when `--skip-existing` was passed and there were no unassigned files (the clusterer never ran); `false` on every actual clustering run. Always present. |
| `mode` | The effective run mode after resolving `auto` — `"fresh"` or `"incremental"`. |
| `method` | The engine that actually grouped the files after resolving `auto` — `"embedding"` or `"llm"`, or `null` when no engine ran (a `skipped` run, an empty workspace, or nothing clusterable). Never `"auto"`: that is a request, not an outcome. Under the default `--method auto` the caller does not pick the engine, and an `auto` run that fell back off an unusable LLM partitioner is otherwise indistinguishable from one that never routed there. |
| `n_assigned_existing` | Number of files assigned to a DocSet that already existed before this run (the incremental "fit an existing cluster" case). |
| `n_new_clusters` | Number of new DocSets created this run (emergent clusters that were LLM-named). |
| `assignments` | Per-file detail: `docset` (final DocSet name), `confidence` (in `[0, 1]`, or `null`), `naming_confidence` (see below), `is_new` (whether the DocSet was created this run), and `review`. `confidence` means different things per `method`. Under `embedding` it is the nearest-prototype softmax peak when the file was matched against an existing DocSet, and the clustering-geometry peak (`0.0` for files the algorithm called noise) for files placed by a fresh clustering run. Under `llm` it is the model's self-reported confidence in the group the file was placed in — shared by every file in that group, `null` when the model declined to report one. Neither is a calibrated probability: both are *ordinal* scores, comparable within one run and not across runs, so use them to rank which assignments to review first rather than as a threshold. `review` is `true` when the run wants a human to confirm that assignment; the file is assigned either way, so `review` never changes `docset`. |
| `review_queue` | The file ids whose `review` flag is set, as a list — the assignments to confirm, without scanning `assignments`. Always present, and always empty unless the clustering config enables calibration (see below). |

`confidence` and `naming_confidence` answer different questions and are
never interchangeable. `confidence` asks *did this file land in the right
group*. `naming_confidence` asks *is that group's name right* — it is the
share of independent naming attempts that agreed on the name a new DocSet was
created with, in `(0, 1]`. It is `null` for files matched to a DocSet that
already existed (nothing was named), and `null` on new DocSets too unless
[`classification.naming_attempts`](#auto-classification) is raised above 1.
A tightly-grouped cluster can still be badly named, so sort new DocSets by
`naming_confidence` to see which names were near-unanimous and which were coin
tosses worth a human look.

LLM naming requires the same workspace setup as `--auto-classify`:

- A `classification` section in `<workspace>/config.toml` (see
  "Auto-classification" above).
- `litellm`, which ships with the base `dgml` install (no extra needed).

If neither is in place, every unmatched cluster's files end up in
`failed_file_ids`; matched files still get assigned. The clustering
algorithm runs via the `dgml-clustering` workspace package
([packages/dgml-core/src/dgml_core/run_clustering.py](../packages/dgml-core/src/dgml_core/run_clustering.py))
— in incremental mode, S3 (few-shot) when existing DocSets have usable
members, S2 (partial-labels, name-only) when they don't; in fresh mode, S1
(unsupervised). See [docs/incremental-clustering.md](incremental-clustering.md)
for the full incremental ("S3") workflow and the evaluation harness.
Files whose first-page image is missing (page render failed at ingest)
are routed into `failed_file_ids` along with LLM-naming failures.

The clustering algorithms are density-based, so they can also decline to
place a document in any cluster — it looks like neither an existing DocSet
nor like the other unassigned files. Those documents are **not** grouped
into a catch-all DocSet (they have nothing in common but the fact that
nothing matched them); they are reported in `failed_file_ids` too, and are
absent from `clusters`. Assign them by hand with `docset add-file`, or
re-run once more of the corpus has been ingested and they have neighbours.

Algorithm settings (encoder, fusion, manifold, training, …) come from
the bundled
[clustering_config.json](../packages/dgml-core/src/dgml_core/clustering_config.json).
Operators can override any subset of them in one of two ways: an optional
`clustering` section in `<workspace>/config.toml` (peer to `classification`),
or a standalone file passed with `--config PATH` (which replaces that section
for the run). Both use the same field schema — see the
[`clustering`](storage-layout.md#clustering-optional) entry in the
storage-layout doc for the field rules. Missing section and no `--config` ⇒
bundled defaults stand.

Errors:

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `MISSING_EXTRA` | The `clustering` extra is not installed. |
| `CLUSTERING_CONFIG_INVALID` | `<workspace>/config.toml` has a `clustering` section that isn't a JSON object, or a field inside it failed schema validation (typo, out-of-enum value, etc.). |

## DocSet commands

```
dgml docset create --name NAME [--description DESC] [--key-question Q ...]
dgml docset list
dgml docset show <docset_id>
dgml docset update <docset_id> [--name NAME] [--description DESC]
dgml docset delete <docset_id>
dgml docset add-file <file_id> --docset <docset_id>   # auto-extracts when the
                                                     # DocSet has an extraction schema
dgml docset remove-file <file_id> --docset <docset_id>
dgml docset list-files <docset_id>
dgml docset generate <docset_id> [--generation-config <profile|path>] [--model <id>] [--label-model <id>] [--window-size <n>] [--max-tokens <n>] [...]
```

`docset delete` removes the DocSet and its file-assignment markers, but
**does not delete the underlying Files**. Files remain in
`<workspace>/files/` and may still belong to other DocSets.

**Auto-extract on assignment.** When the target DocSet has an extraction
schema set (`extraction-schema.rnc`), every assignment path fires value
extraction on the newly-assigned file: `docset add-file`, `file add
--auto-classify` (existing-DocSet decisions, which is every decision under
`--auto-classify existing`), and `cluster` (existing-DocSet
matches — a DocSet created mid-run can't have a schema yet). The payload
gains an `extraction` block; extraction failures are **soft** (the error
lands in `extraction.error`, the assignment stands, exit stays 0). No schema
→ plain assignment, no block.

```json
{
  "docset_id": "o8vr8rs488vg",
  "file_id": "5kqt9r5fowno",
  "assigned": true,
  "extraction": {
    "performed": true,
    "model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-pro",
    "tool_calls": 0,
    "error": null
  }
}
```

### `dgml docset generate <docset_id> [flags]`

Run the typed-block PDF→DGML pipeline over every file in a DocSet: each
PDF is transcribed window-by-window into a flat list of typed JSON blocks
(`generation.model`), then ONE batch-wide semantic-labeling call assigns
concept tags across all of the docset's documents at once
(`generation.label_model`), and the result is rendered deterministically
into a namespaced `dg:chunk`
document. The labeling vocabulary (the "roster") is planned automatically
from the documents, or supplied up front with `--schema-path` — which skips
planning and **closes** the vocabulary, so the output carries your tag names and
no others (see [Supplying your own tag schema](#supplying-your-own-tag-schema)). Unseeded runs are staged: the largest documents label first (a
pilot), their observed evidence — verbatim example values, kinds, hierarchy —
confirms the planned vocabulary, and the rest of the batch labels against it.
There is no separate transform pass.

**Incremental, consistent growth.** Already-generated files are skipped (see
resume below), so adding a document and re-running generates only the new one.
To keep its tags consistent with the existing docset, the new document is
labeled seeded with the docset's own `authored-schema.json` if a previous
`--schema-path` run supplied one, else its derived `schema.json` — full
fidelity: role descriptions, observed examples, kind, hierarchy — else the flat
`cache/concept_roster.json` (default; disable all three with `--no-roster`).
A remembered **authored** schema closes the vocabulary, so an added document is
labeled against exactly the tags you supplied; a **derived** `schema.json` only
seeds, and labeling still coins for roles it doesn't cover. Every concept is emitted in the per-docset
`docset:` vocabulary namespace (`dg:` is framework-only), so growing the docset
never flips a tag's prefix. An already-generated file is still re-rendered
deterministically when its output changes as the docset's schema/roster grows
(e.g. entity-container grouping) — no re-transcription or re-labeling. These
show up in the top-level `rerendered` list.

Output always goes to the docset directory in the workspace
(`<workspace>/docsets/<docset-id>/`) — there is no output-directory flag,
so artifact placement is deterministic. Each file's generated DGML lands in
its per-(docset, file) directory at
`<workspace>/docsets/<docset-id>/files/<file-id>/<stem>.dgml.xml`. The
`cache/` at the docset root holds the small functional files the next run
reloads (`*_blocks.json`, `label_*_cNN_raw.json`, `concept_roster.json`) and
is always written. Its debug-only artifacts (raw LLM dumps,
`*.concept.xml`/`*.semantic.xml`, prompt listings) and `coverage_report.json`
are written only under the global `--debug` flag — a default run leaves the
workspace with final files plus that functional cache. The docset root also
gets `schema.json` (the generation tag schema, written during labeling) and —
at the very end of the run, after grounding and the semlink pass —
`full-schema.rnc`: the same schema rendered as RELAX NG Compact with the data
types observed in the final XML, losslessly reversible back to `schema.json`
(see [storage-layout.md](storage-layout.md)). The RNC render is the form that
ships in DGMLX bundles and is hashed into the file attestation.

**Grounding is part of generation.** After each `<stem>.dgml.xml` is
rendered it is grounded *in place* against the file's page OCR — a
`dg:origin` bounding-box attribute is added to every element whose
subtree grounded (leaf elements, mixed-content parents, *and* pure
containers), so the canonical `<stem>.dgml.xml` already carries page
positions. This pass is fully
deterministic (no LLM, no config): the DGML tree and the OCR word stream
are both "the document in reading order", so it is solved as a sequence
alignment (rare-n-gram anchoring + windowed diff), with a
weighted-similarity recovery pass for OCR noise, a span-search rescue for
repeated content, and a row-context pass for punctuation-only cells,
interleaved multi-line table cells, and digit-discrepant text. A file
with no `page_text/`
is written but left ungrounded, with a warning — it does not fail the run.

**The `dg:origin` attribute.** Qualified to whatever URI the document binds
the `dg` prefix to (the open `dgml.io` scheme on generated DGML; plain
`origin` on namespace-free XML). Its value is a `"; "`-separated list of
boxes, each `<page> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>` (space-separated) in integer image
pixels — top-left origin, 300 dpi, relative to the page's
`page_images/page_N.png`:

```xml
<docset:Body structure="h3"
    dg:origin="3 307 367 1098 428; 4 307 254 1093 376">...
```

Elements with text-node children carry one box per visual line on each
page — the CSS `getClientRects()` analogue, uniform for leaves and
mixed-content parents. Pure containers (all-element children — sections,
lists, tables, rows, the document root) carry one union box per page — the
`getBoundingClientRect()` analogue — covering their grounded subtree. An
element is annotated only when at least half of its subtree's tokens
grounded.

**The `dg:style` attribute.** Alongside `dg:origin`, the grounding pass also
emits `dg:style` — observed visual formatting as inline CSS that can be copied
verbatim into an HTML `style` attribute. It is **sparse**: emitted only when a
property is evident in the source and applied at the most specific element
where observable, chosen by char-weighted majority over the element's own text
(if more than half a chunk's characters are bold, the whole chunk is bold).
Like `dg:origin`, it is qualified to the document's `dg` URI.

An inheriting property (`color`, `font-*`, `text-align`, `text-transform`,
`white-space`) is emitted only on the element that *introduces* it — a
descendant that would merely inherit the same value from an ancestor does not
repeat it (`dg:style` is copied verbatim into HTML `style`, where these
properties inherit). So a paragraph rendered entirely red carries
`color: red` once, on the paragraph — not again on every inner span.
Conversely, a descendant whose own formatting *differs* from what it would
inherit carries the overriding value **even when that value is the CSS
default** — e.g. a plain run inside a bold heading emits `font-weight: normal`,
so it doesn't render bold under HTML inheritance. Non-inheriting properties
(`text-decoration`, `background-color`) are never suppressed this way.

```xml
<docset:CompanyName dg:structure="span" dg:style="font-weight: bold; color: gray">Acme Corp</docset:CompanyName>
```

For `--text-mode digital` and `hybrid`, the facts are read deterministically
from the PDF's glyphs via pdfminer (font weight/slant from the font name, size,
and text fill color), carried through `page_text/page_N.json`. The deterministic
path derives `font-weight`, `font-style`, `font-size` (an `em` bucket relative to
the page's modal body size: `0.75em | 1em | 1.25em | 1.5em | 2em`), `color` (any
CSS named color), and `text-transform: uppercase` (all-caps text).
`--text-mode ocr` carries no font facts, so `dg:style` is empty there unless the
workspace opts into the image-based path by setting `enabled = true` in the
`style` section of `config.toml` (the section ships disabled; it optionally
names a vision `model` — see [storage-layout.md](storage-layout.md)). That path assesses the
same properties from the page image **plus `text-align`** (which needs the
rendered layout to judge). It is honored only for OCR files and never competes
with the deterministic digital/hybrid path. A malformed `style` section fails
`generate` up front with `STYLE_CONFIG_INVALID`.

Requires only the base `dgml` install — the generation pipeline reuses
the workspace's pre-rendered `page_images/page_N.png` files at LLM
input time, so no extra rasterizer is needed at run time (and no
GPL/poppler escape hatch). For non-workspace inputs (library callers
passing arbitrary paths), the pipeline renders to a tempdir via the
same canonical `pages.render_pages` (the configured engine — ghostscript by
default; see [PDF engine configuration](#pdf-engine-configuration)).

The models are **not** CLI flags — like every other model-consuming command
(`extraction generate-schema`, `extraction extract`, `discover`), `generate` reads them
solely from the merged config, so each is one visible, deliberate choice. Each
model resolves from its per-task field (`generation.model`,
`generation.label_model`) or, when unset, its `[models]` tier (`standard` for
transcription, `advanced` for labeling). There is no code default: if neither a
field nor a tier names a model it fails with `GENERATION_CONFIG_MISSING`, a
malformed one with `GENERATION_CONFIG_INVALID`. The two models carry independent
credentials (`api_key`/`api_key_env`/`api_base` for transcription,
`label_api_key`/`label_api_key_env`/`label_api_base` for labeling) since they may
name different providers. See the [`generation` config
section](storage-layout.md#generation-required-for-dgml-docset-generate).
| `--window-size <n>` | `10` | Pages per transcription window. |
| `--temperature <f>` | `0.0` | LLM temperature. |
| `--max-tokens <n>` | `32000` | LLM max output tokens per call. |
| `--no-coverage` | off | Skip word-coverage metrics (unique-lexicon recall, ROUGE-1/2) computed against the workspace `page_text/`. |
| `--cache-dir <dir>` | `<docset-dir>/cache` | Directory for the generation cache (functional `*_blocks.json` / `label_*_cNN_raw.json` / `concept_roster.json`, always written; plus per-window debug snapshots when `--debug` is set). |

The global `--debug` flag also writes the per-file
`<stem>.dgml.grounding_stats.json` sidecar (grounding match rates,
ungrounded snippets); the `dg:origin` boxes themselves are always written
into `<stem>.dgml.xml` regardless.
| `--max-parallel-calls <n>` | `4` | Max documents transcribed concurrently (windows *within* a document stay serial). The LLM call is network-bound, so threads overlap the latency. Set to `1` to disable. Tune to your provider's RPM tier — e.g. Gemini free ~10-15 RPM, Gemini paid Flash 500 RPM, OpenAI free 500 RPM, Anthropic tier-1 ~50 RPM. |
| `--schema-path <f>` | none | The tag schema to label against, in any of four forms detected by **content** (not by file extension) — see [Supplying your own tag schema](#supplying-your-own-tag-schema). Supplying a schema means the generated DGML uses **those tag names and no others**: the planning pass is skipped and the vocabulary is closed. Content whose role has no matching tag is **not** dropped — it renders as `dg:chunk` with its text, structure, and `dg:origin` intact. Role descriptions, curated examples, and kind all feed the labeling prompt; the tag hierarchy (`parent_role`) seeds entity-container grouping. To let labeling invent its own vocabulary instead, don't supply a schema. |
| `--extend-schema` | off | Treat the supplied schema as a **foundation** rather than the whole vocabulary: your tag names are reused wherever one fits, and labeling may coin a new name for a recurring role your schema doesn't cover. Coined names are reported per file under `added_concepts` — the candidate list for your next revision. Requires a supplied schema (`--schema-path`, or one a previous run remembered); errors without one. The mode is **per-run**, not remembered — a later run with no flags goes back to strict. |
| `--no-roster` | off | Disable automatic vocabulary reuse. By default an incremental generate seeds labeling from the docset's own `authored-schema.json` (whatever a previous `--schema-path` run supplied), else its derived `schema.json` (full fidelity: descriptions, observed examples, kind, hierarchy), else the flat `cache/concept_roster.json`, so newly-added documents stay tag-consistent with the existing docset; this flag labels them in isolation instead. A remembered **authored** schema closes the vocabulary exactly as `--schema-path` does; a schema the pipeline **derived** only seeds, and labeling keeps coining. Only the authored slot seeds entity-container grouping. Ignored when `--schema-path` is given. |
| `--no-semlinks` | off | Skip the final semantic-link pass. By default each grounded `<stem>.dgml.xml` gets semantic links added in place — relationships the tree's nesting can't capture, written as `dg:itemprop` (predicate) + `dg:href` (`#id`, or space-separated `#id`s) on the subject, with `xml:id`s assigned to both ends. Covers references (`references`, `incorporates`, `signatoryOf`, …), relative dates (`relativeTo`/`effectiveOn`, ISO-8601 offset in `dg:value`), and derived values (`greaterOf`/`lesserOf` formulas, `escalates`, `valueFrom`). The model proposes links on the labeling model (`generation.label_model`), then a skeptical pass verifies them. Each converted file's `results` entry carries a `links` count. |
| `--no-semlink-cache` | off | Always call the model for the semantic-link pass. By default the pass is cached on what the model actually reads — tag names and text, plus the labeling model, the link prompts, and whether the review pass runs. Attributes are deliberately excluded, because the prompt never shows them: grounding a document or renaming a namespace prefix does not change its links, so those runs replay the cache instead of paying again. The cache stores the links themselves, not a second copy of the XML, and they are written onto whatever the current render produced. This flag forces a fresh call — use it when something the key cannot see has changed, such as a provider-side model update behind a stable model id. |
| `--no-semlink-verify` | off | Skip the second, skeptical pass that reviews each proposed link. The link pass then makes one model call per document instead of two, which cuts its wall-clock time by about 60%, and keeps roughly twice as many links — including the weaker ones the review would have dropped. Use it when you want breadth and speed over precision. Reviewed and unreviewed results are cached separately. |

**Document-level resume.** If a file's per-(docset, file)
`<stem>.dgml.xml` already holds a generated document tree, that file is
skipped — a crashed run can be re-invoked with the same arguments and only
unfinished documents are re-processed. Within a re-processed document,
transcription itself also resumes: a cached `cache/<stem>_blocks.json`
(written right after Pass A) is reloaded verbatim instead of re-transcribing,
so re-running a document whose output was removed — or relabeling a docset
after deleting its `.dgml.xml` outputs and label caches — pays only for
labeling and rendering. Delete the `_blocks.json` file to force a fresh
transcription. When *every* assigned file is already
converted the command exits 0 with the same envelope
(`summary.converted == 0`, each file a `skipped` entry in `results`) and no
LLM call is made. An **extraction-only** file (a `dg:extraction` with no
tree, from running `extraction extract` first) does *not* count as
converted: generate builds its tree and carries the existing
`dg:extraction` over into the fresh render (`full-extraction`). The same
carry-over protects re-rendered files — a namespacing-driven re-render
never drops extracted values.

Payload on a normal run — the shared batch envelope (`summary` count block +
per-item `results`, each carrying a `status`), matching the bulk `file add`:

```json
{
  "docset_id": "p9pjusnwg50l",
  "docset_name": "Q2 contracts",
  "summary": { "total": 3, "converted": 2, "skipped": 1, "failed": 0 },
  "models": { "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5", "label_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6", "source": "config" },
  "rerendered": [],
  "output_key": "docsets/p9pjusnwg50l",
  "coverage_report": "docsets/p9pjusnwg50l/coverage_report.json",
  "results": [
    {"status": "skipped", "file_id": "ab55kdjs93kk", "source": "already-done.pdf", "output": "docsets/p9pjusnwg50l/files/ab55kdjs93kk/already-done.dgml.xml"},
    {"status": "converted", "file_id": "k7q3xb91pmrf", "source": "contract-a.pdf", "output": "docsets/p9pjusnwg50l/files/k7q3xb91pmrf/contract-a.dgml.xml", "grounded": true, "matched_token_pct": 99.6, "elements_annotated": 445}
  ]
}
```

`models` records the effective transcription/labeling models actually used for
the run and a `source` recording where they came from — `config` (workspace
`generation` section), `profile:<name>` or `file` (from `--generation-config`),
`override` (from `--model`/`--label-model`), or a combination such as
`profile:fast+override`. This keeps the model choice visible/recorded in the
run's own output, not just in `config.json`.

`summary` counts always sum to `total`: every assigned file lands in exactly
one of `converted` / `skipped` / `failed`. A per-file problem does not abort
the run — it becomes a `failed` entry in `results` and the batch continues,
exiting 0 (partial success, matching `dgml cluster`).
Three things produce a `failed` entry:

- **`FILE_NOT_FOUND`** — the file's source is missing from
  `<workspace>/files/<file_id>/`.
- **`GENERATION_FAILED`** — the pipeline produced no output for the file
  (transcription failed and was skipped internally), **or** two assigned files
  share a filename (the pipeline keys documents by filename and can't tell them
  apart, so both are failed; rename to convert them). When transcription failed
  with a captured cause (e.g. an LLM/provider error that survived retries), the
  `error.message` carries a short, single-line summary of it — so the reason is
  available without `--verbose`. The full, untruncated error still goes to
  stderr under `--verbose`.

`output_key` is the docset's storage key (`docsets/<docset-id>`); per-file DGML
lands under its `files/<file-id>/` subdirectory (see each `results` entry's
`output`). Both `output_key` and `coverage_report` are store-native keys, not
local paths, so the envelope is meaningful whatever backend the workspace uses.
`coverage_report` is the report key only when a report was actually written;
it is `null` when `--no-coverage` is set, no file had `page_text/`, or
`--debug` was not passed (coverage is still computed and its per-file summary
printed under `--verbose`, but the `coverage_report.json` file is written only
under `--debug`).

A `failed` entry looks like:

```json
{ "status": "failed", "file_id": "ab55kdjs93kk", "source": "gone.pdf",
  "error": { "code": "FILE_NOT_FOUND", "message": "source not found at ..." } }
```

A `converted` entry carries `output` (the written DGML path), `links` (the
semantic-link count; `link_error` appears instead when the link pass could not run, and the document keeps its unlinked DGML), the grounding fields (`grounded`, then either
`matched_token_pct` + `elements_annotated` or `grounding_error`), and — **only
when that file's labeling could not reach the model at all** (a wrong/absent
`generation.label_model` key, a bad model id, or a network error) — a
`label_error`:

```json
{ "status": "converted", "file_id": "k7q3xb91pmrf", "source": "contract-a.pdf",
  "output": "/ws/.../contract-a.dgml.xml", "links": 0, "grounded": true,
  "matched_token_pct": 99.6, "elements_annotated": 445,
  "label_error": { "code": "LABEL_MODEL_UNREACHABLE", "message": "AuthenticationError: ..." } }
```

The document still converts (`status: "converted"`, exit 0) — it just renders
without concept tags. `label_error` makes a misconfigured `label_model` visible
in the normal JSON, not only under `--verbose`. It is present *only* on affected
files (like `grounding_error`), and only for a hard "couldn't reach the model"
failure — a model that runs but simply produces few/no labels is a normal soft
outcome and is not flagged. Most misconfigurations are caught earlier by the
pre-flight check below; `label_error` covers the runtime failures that slip past
it (a transient network/rate-limit error, or a well-formed but nonexistent model
id).

Errors (run-level, error envelope + exit 1):

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `DOCSET_NOT_FOUND` | `<docset_id>` does not exist. |
| `EMPTY_DOCSET` | DocSet exists but has no files assigned. |
| `GENERATION_CONFIG_MISSING` | A generation model can't be resolved — neither the per-task field (`generation.model` / `generation.label_model`) nor its `[models]` tier (`standard` / `advanced`) is set in the merged config. |
| `GENERATION_CONFIG_INVALID` | The `generation` section is malformed (bad model string, both `api_key` and `api_key_env` set, etc.). A **pre-flight check** (before any transcription spend) also raises this for a model string with no resolvable provider. |
| `AUTH_ERROR` | Pre-flight check: the API key for `model` or `label_model`'s provider is absent (and no `api_key` / `api_key_env` set). Skipped when `generation.api_base` is set, since a custom endpoint may authenticate differently. |

> stdout is a single JSON object. The transcription / labeling / render
> progress lines go to stderr, and only when `--verbose` is passed.

#### Supplying your own tag schema

`--schema-path` takes the vocabulary you want to see in the generated DGML.
The pipeline then stops inventing one and labels against yours instead.

There are two ways to use it, for two different situations:

| you want | use | what comes out |
|---|---|---|
| only your vocabulary | `--schema-path X` | your tag names and **no others** |
| your vocabulary, plus whatever you missed | `--schema-path X --extend-schema` | your names reused first; new names coined only for roles you didn't cover, each reported back |

**Strict** is for when the schema *is* the specification — a fixed downstream
contract, a regulated vocabulary, anything where an unexpected tag is a defect.
**Extend** is for when you have a solid foundation but expect gaps: you get your
vocabulary applied first and a reviewed list of what the documents needed beyond
it, which you fold into the next revision.

> **How much of the output stays under your tags depends on how much of the
> document your schema covers** — a property of your documents, not of how many
> tags you wrote. The same schema can carry most of a short, regular document
> and a quarter of a long, dense one.
>
> So on rich documents extend adds far more than it reuses, and
> `added_concepts` gets long. That is the mode working — those are real
> recurring roles your schema does not name — but the output is then mostly not
> your vocabulary. To keep it yours on a dense corpus, either grow the schema
> until it covers the document, or use strict and let unmatched content stay
> untagged.

> **Extend is an authoring aid, not a setting to leave on.** Your supplied tags
> are stable across runs by construction; the names it *coins* are not — the
> supplement is largely re-invented each run, which is the tag drift DGML exists
> to prevent. Treat extend as one step in a loop: run it, review
> `added_concepts`, fold what you want into your schema, then run strict for
> output you intend to keep or query.

Neither mode is a way to improve extraction accuracy — against a no-schema run
neither scores better. What a supplied schema buys is control: your vocabulary,
applied consistently, with a report of what fell outside it.

Neither mode plans a vocabulary of its own, and both keep every downstream pass
— grounding, semantic links, value typing, table and list consolidation — exactly
as a default run does. What a supplied schema removes is vocabulary *invention*,
not augmentation.

> **This drives the whole document, not field extraction.** The schema is
> applied to *every* element of the document tree — heading, clause, paragraph,
> list item, table row, cell, inline value. DGML's separate
> [extraction schema](#extraction-commands) (`extraction-schema.rnc`, driven by
> `dgml extraction`) is what selects a few typed fields into a
> `<dg:extraction>` subtree; that is a different feature and this flag does not
> touch it.

**Four input forms**, detected by content so the flag stays one flag:

*A — a plain tag list.* One name per line; blank lines and `#` comments ignored.

```
# Liquor distribution purchase orders
CustomerName
PurchaseOrderNumber
OrderDate
ProductDescription
Quantity
UnitPrice
PaymentTerms
```

*B — names with descriptions (recommended).* A JSON object mapping each name to
a one-line description of the role it plays.

```json
{
  "CustomerName":        "Legal name of the customer placing the order",
  "PurchaseOrderNumber": "Identifier the customer assigned to this order",
  "OrderDate":           "Date the order was placed",
  "PaymentTerms":        "Terms governing when payment is due"
}
```

*C — a full `schema.json`.* Use this when you need structural `kind`, example
values, or hierarchy. It is also what `docset generate` exports, so a natural
workflow is to generate once, hand-edit the export, and feed it back.

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "OrderLines":  { "role": "The table of ordered products",
                     "kind": "section" },
    "OrderLine":   { "role": "One product line on the order",
                     "kind": "row",    "parent_role": "OrderLines" },
    "OrderQuantity": { "role": "Number of units ordered on a line",
                       "kind": "inline", "parent_role": "OrderLine" }
  },
  "notes": "Free-form notes about this docset's vocabulary."
}
```

*D — `full-schema.rnc`*, the lossless RELAX NG Compact render of the same
information, also written by `docset generate`. Recognized by the `.rnc` suffix.

| field | required | what it does | reaches the model? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **name** | yes | The tag emitted in the DGML, as `<docset:Name>`. | yes, verbatim |
| **role** / description | no, but **recommended** | One line describing what the tag holds; what the model matches content against. This is the field worth writing. | yes, first 100 characters |
| **kind** | no — defaults to `inline` | `section` (a region grouping other content), `row` (a repeating record in a table), `inline` (an atomic value). | yes, as `[section]` / `[row]` / `[value]` |
| **examples** | no — and not recommended | Representative real values; up to 3 stored. Testing found no benefit, and a way they can hurt: tags carrying examples get used less, while tags without them absorb that content — the example reads as a fence rather than a hint. Put the effort into `role` instead. | yes, first 2, 60 characters each |
| **parent_role** | no | Name of the tag that contains this one; groups related values under a shared container. Must name a tag the schema declares. | **no** — used deterministically |

**Tag names are taken verbatim.** `Notes`, `Details` and `Line Items` are all
accepted and preserved. The one transformation: characters illegal in an XML
element name become underscores, so `Line Items` is emitted as `Line_Items` —
`--verbose` reports every such rewrite. Write `LineItems` if that is what you
want to see.

**Matching is forgiving about style, strict about words.** `customername`,
`Customer_Name`, `CUSTOMER-NAME` and `Customer Name` all resolve to
`CustomerName`, so you will not lose values to a capitalization mismatch. A
*semantic* alias does not: `NameOfCustomer`, `ClientName`, `CustFirstLast` and
even `CustomerNames` are **rejected**, and that block renders untagged. Guessing
that two differently-named things mean the same role is how values end up under
the wrong tag, and a wrong tag is harder to notice than a missing one.

**Nothing is deleted.** "Closed" describes the tag vocabulary, not the output.
A block whose role has no matching tag is emitted as a generic `dg:chunk`
carrying its full text, its structural role, and its `dg:origin` page
coordinates. A short schema does not produce a short document — it produces the
same document with fewer semantically-tagged elements.

**Read the off-schema list.** Every converted file's `results` entry reports
the concepts that fell outside your schema — as `unmatched_concepts` under
strict (refused, so this is what your schema is missing) or `added_concepts`
under `--extend-schema` (coined and used, so this is what to consider adding):

```json
{ "status": "converted", "file_id": "k7q3xb91pmrf", "source": "order-a.pdf",
  "unmatched_concepts": { "count": 12, "distinct": 3,
    "examples": ["ProductPartNumber", "ShipVia", "NameOfCustomer"] } }
```

It is the fastest way to find gaps: rejects that look like roles you forgot mean
add them; rejects that look like aliases of tags you already have mean rename
them in your schema.

Two things worth knowing:

- `ColumnHeader` is a tag the renderer itself emits for a table's printed
  column-title row. Under a closed vocabulary it obeys the same rule as
  everything else, so declare it if you want those cells tagged.
- Up to 400 tags are shown to the model per call; a larger vocabulary loses its
  tail. Around 30 tags with one-line descriptions is a good target.

**The schema you supply is protected from the run's own output.** It is stored
verbatim (in canonical Schema v1 form) as `docsets/<id>/authored-schema.json`,
which the derived `schema.json` never overwrites — so a later `generate` with no
flags re-seeds from what you wrote, not from `yours + everything coined`.

```bash
# Strict: the output carries your tag names and no others
uv run dgml docset generate <docset_id> --schema-path ./my-schema.json

# Later runs remember the schema — no need to re-supply the file
uv run dgml docset generate <docset_id>

# Extend: your vocabulary first, gaps coined and reported as added_concepts
uv run dgml docset generate <docset_id> --schema-path ./my-schema.json --extend-schema
```

**Ordinary incremental runs are unaffected.** Closure follows *authorship*, not
the mere presence of a seed. A schema **you** wrote is a specification and is
applied as one; a `schema.json` the **pipeline** derived from its own labels is
a consistency hint, so the automatic reuse an incremental `generate` has always
done still seeds and still coins. Adding a document to a docset that never had
a supplied schema behaves exactly as before.

> **Grounding is part of `generate`.** There is no separate `dgml docset
> ground` command — `generate` writes `dg:origin` boxes into each
> `<stem>.dgml.xml` itself (see above). To re-run *just* the grounding pass
> on already-generated XML without regenerating (a maintenance/debug
> operation outside the public CLI), use `scripts/ground.py`:
> `uv run python scripts/ground.py --docset <id> [--file <id>] [--debug]`.

## Extraction commands

Schema-driven value extraction pulls a defined set of fields out of a document
and grounds each value back to the source page. It is distinct from `docset
generate`, which transcribes the *whole* document.

Two formats are involved:

- **Schema** — the canonical at-rest form is **RELAX NG Compact**
  (`extraction-schema.rnc`, per the DGML spec §12/§13). The CLI also *accepts*
  a JSON Schema on input and converts it to RNC before storing (see
  `set-schema` below for the accepted dialects). Schemas may carry
  `## Prompt:` annotations guiding the LLM where to find each field, and a
  field's content model may be a **value enumeration**
  (`( "electric" | "water" | … )`) constraining the normalized value to a
  closed token set — extraction then returns the verbatim page text plus the
  classifying token as `dg:value`.
- **Values** — extraction writes a `dg:extraction` element **inside the file's
  core `<stem>.dgml.xml`** (spec §13), holding the schema's fields as `docset:`
  elements with `dg:value`/`xsi:type` and `dg:origin`. There is no separate
  values file. Two modes (reported as `mode` on the `extract` payload):
  `full-extraction` when the file already has a generated document tree (the
  `dg:extraction` is added as a sibling), or `extraction` when the core file is
  created with only the `dg:extraction` element. The CLI can return the values
  as values-shape JSON on request.

The LLM is configurable like every other model-using command — via the
`grounded` section of the workspace `config.toml` (`schema_model`,
`values_model`, API keys, `max_tool_iters`), with per-call overrides on the
commands below.

### `dgml extraction generate-schema <docset_id> [--from-file ID ...] [--schema-model M]`

Ask the configured `schema_model` to propose an extraction schema from one or
more sample PDFs, then store it as `extraction-schema.rnc`. `--from-file` is repeatable and
defaults to every file in the DocSet. Errors `NO_FILES` if the DocSet is empty
and no `--from-file` is given.

The model submits a **typed field tree** — each leaf carries the XSD datatype it
chose (`date`, `decimal`, `integer`, `boolean`, `gYear`, …, or `text`) — which
is rendered straight to the at-rest RNC (leaves emit `xsd:date`, `xsd:decimal`,
etc.). There is no grounded-field JSON Schema intermediate; datatypes are native
to the generated schema, and downstream extraction normalizes each typed value
to a `dg:value`/`xsi:type`. The output shape is unchanged.

```json
{
  "docset_id": "o8vr8rs488vg",
  "schema_format": "rnc",
  "schema": "namespace dg = \"http://dgml.io/ns/dg#\"\n...",
  "from_file_ids": ["5kqt9r5fowno"],
  "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-5"
}
```

### `dgml extraction set-schema <docset_id> --schema-file PATH`

Set the DocSet's extraction schema from a file. Accepts a `.rnc` (RELAX NG
Compact) or `.json` (JSON Schema) document — JSON is converted to RNC.
Anything outside the supported RNC subset is rejected with `SCHEMA_INVALID`.
RNC is the only on-disk form. Returns `{docset_id, schema_format: "rnc", schema}`.

Accepted JSON dialects (all convert to the same RNC):

- the engine's own projection (`get-schema --schema-format json` output):
  leaves are `{"$ref": "#/definitions/extracted_value"}` with optional
  `datatype` / `value_enum` / `prompt` / `example` / `description` /
  `item_name` sidecar keys on the property node (legacy `grounded_field`
  refs and the grounded/computed `anyOf` union are still accepted);
- **standard-dialect schemas** (e.g. draft 2020-12 exports from another
  system): a root `$ref`, local `$defs`/`definitions` `$ref`s (sibling
  annotation keys merge over the target), `title` as the DGML element name,
  and leaves recognized *structurally* — an object whose properties are a
  subset of `{text, value, locations, derived_from, computed}` with `text`
  present is a leaf, its `value` subschema mapped to the field type
  (`enum` list → value enumeration; `format: date` / `type: integer` /
  `boolean` / `number` / a plain-decimal `pattern` → the XSD datatype).

Same-named tags must share one identical definition; two definitions with the
same name but different content or annotations are rejected with
`SCHEMA_INVALID` (rename one, e.g. by qualifying it with its parent). When a top-level
field's identical definition is also referenced inside a nested structure, the
rendered RNC carries an explicit `start` rule so the field stays a root.

### `dgml extraction get-schema <docset_id> [--schema-format rnc|json]`

Return the DocSet's schema as canonical RNC (default) or as the engine's
JSON Schema projection (`--schema-format json`), whose leaves are
`extracted_value` refs (`{text, value?, locations?, computed?, derived_from?}`
— note: projections exported before the merged leaf shape used a
`grounded_field`/`computed_field` union; both are still accepted on
`set-schema` input). Errors `SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND` if none is set.

### `dgml extraction set-guidance <docset_id> --guidance-file PATH`

Set docset-level **extraction guidance** from a markdown/plain-text file —
free-form domain rules that apply to the whole document kind rather than any
one field (classification decision rules, disambiguation conventions,
cross-field consistency rules the extractor should honor). Stored verbatim at
`docsets/<id>/extraction-guidance.md` beside `extraction-schema.rnc`, and
injected into the phase-1 extraction prompt (after the schema, before the
document) on every `extract` against the DocSet. Complements the per-field
`## Prompt:` annotations in the schema; use guidance for rules that span
fields, prompts for where to find one value. Returns
`{docset_id, guidance}`.

### `dgml extraction get-guidance <docset_id>`

Return the DocSet's extraction guidance as `{docset_id, guidance}`. Errors
`GUIDANCE_NOT_FOUND` if none is set.

### `dgml extraction extract <docset_id> <file_id> [--values-model M]`

Extract values from a file against the DocSet schema and write a `dg:extraction`
element into the file's core `<stem>.dgml.xml`. Runs a three-phase pipeline
(LLM text+pages → code OCR matching → per-page LLM bbox). If the file already has
a generated document tree the extraction is added alongside it
(`mode: full-extraction`); otherwise a minimal core file is created
(`mode: extraction`). `extraction_stats.json` is written only under the global
`--debug` flag. Errors `SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND` if the DocSet has no schema.

```json
{
  "docset_id": "o8vr8rs488vg",
  "file_id": "5kqt9r5fowno",
  "model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-pro",
  "mode": "full-extraction",
  "tool_calls": 2,
  "field_count": 7,
  "xml_key": "docsets/o8vr8rs488vg/files/5kqt9r5fowno/Invoice 2025.dgml.xml"
}
```

> `generate` and `extract` compose in either order: extract-then-generate
> builds the tree and carries the `dg:extraction` over; generate-then-extract
> embeds the extraction alongside the existing tree. Both end at
> `full-extraction`.

### `dgml extraction get-values <docset_id> <file_id> [--as values|xml]`

Return previously extracted values from the file's core `<stem>.dgml.xml`.
`--as values` (default) projects the `dg:extraction` element to values-shape
JSON; `--as xml` returns the core DGML document. Errors `VALUES_NOT_FOUND` if the
file has no `dg:extraction` element yet (extraction not run).

```json
{
  "docset_id": "o8vr8rs488vg",
  "file_id": "5kqt9r5fowno",
  "format": "values",
  "values": {
    "LiabilityCap": {
      "text": "$500,000",
      "value": "500000",
      "locations": [{"page_number": 2, "bounding_box": [460, 310, 1800, 355]}]
    }
  }
}
```

A leaf whose schema `## Prompt:` describes a derivation rule (spec §13) comes
back **computed** instead of grounded: `computed: true`, no `locations`, and
`derived_from` listing the dotted paths of the values it was derived from
(cross-file or unresolvable `dg:href` targets stay as raw references):

```json
{
  "InvoiceTotal": {
    "text": "$349.85",
    "value": "349.85",
    "computed": true,
    "derived_from": ["LineItems[0].Quantity", "LineItems[0].UnitPrice"]
  }
}
```

In the XML form (`--as xml`), the same field carries `dg:origin="computed"`,
`dg:value`, and `dg:itemprop="computedFrom"`/`dg:href` pointing at the source
elements, which are stamped with matching `xml:id` attributes.

**Schema-authoring rule for derivations:** every input a `## Prompt:`
derivation rule mentions must itself be an extracted field in the schema.
The model can fold any page content into its arithmetic, but `dg:href` can
only point at extracted elements — an un-extracted input leaves the computed
value unverifiable. A `derived_from` entry that doesn't resolve is dropped
from `dg:href` and counted in `extraction_stats.json` under
`matching.dropped_refs` (written under `--debug`); a computed field that ends
up with no `dg:href` at all is flagged by `dgml check` as
`computed_field_unattributed`.

Extraction asks each model for its own maximum output (128K on current
frontier Claude/Gemini, 64K on Haiku 4.5 — read from the provider's model
metadata and clamped per model, so no request exceeds a model's ceiling).
A phase-1 turn that still clips that ceiling (`finish_reason='length'`)
reports the truncation explicitly and is retried once in **chunked** mode:
the model calls `submit_values` with `done: false` (scalars + first array
batches) and extends arrays with repeated `append_entries` calls, `done: true`
on the last — merged and vocabulary-checked code-side, transparent in the CLI
payloads. Chunking is strictly that escalation: an ordinary run is never
offered the continuation tool or the `done` flag, so it can't split output
that fits in one call. `extraction_stats.json` records both under
`phases.phase1`: `chunk_calls` (1 = ordinary single submission) and
`truncated_retries`.

**Schema-declared invariants.** A field may carry a `## Invariant:` annotation
naming a checkable relation against the rest of the submission — the
machine-checkable counterpart to the prose rules in a docset's
`extraction-guidance.md`, which a model can silently ignore:

```rnc
## Number of line items on the invoice
## Invariant: count(LineItems)
LineItemCount =
  element docset:LineItemCount {
    xsd:integer
  }
```

Two forms: `count(Path.To.Collection)` (exact) and
`sum(Path.To.Collection[].LeafName)` (within $0.05). Both are **report-only** —
values are never adjusted to satisfy one — and results land in
`extraction_stats.json` as `invariants_checked` / `invariants_violated`, with
each violation's text under `invariant_violations`. A field or collection that
wasn't extracted is skipped rather than counted, since every field is nullable.

Two limits are deliberate and decide whether a rule is expressible: an
invariant is **one term** (`sum(A[].x) + sum(B[].y)` has no form — a rule
spanning two collections must not be approximated by one of them, which would
flag correct output), and paths resolve **from the submission root through
object hops only** (a field inside a collection entry cannot reference a
sibling collection within that entry). Anything outside the two forms is
rejected with `SCHEMA_INVALID` at load, so an unexpressible rule fails loudly
instead of never running.

`extraction_stats.json`'s `matching` block also reports
`unnormalized_enum_values` (enum-field leaves whose returned value wasn't one
of the schema's tokens — those serialize text-only, never guessed) and a
report-only derivation recompute: `derivations_checked` /
`derivations_mismatched` (computed leaves whose numeric inputs all resolve
are recomputed; a leaf mismatches when its value agrees with neither the sum,
the count, nor any single input within $0.05). The top-level
`phase1_tool_schema` field records whether the docset schema rode inside the
`submit_values` tool parameter (`"inlined"`, provider-enforced shape) or
extraction fell back to a permissive parameter with code-side vocabulary
pruning (`"permissive"` — the retry path when a provider rejects a very large
inlined schema, e.g. Gemini's "too many states for serving").

Errors across the group: `DOCSET_NOT_FOUND`, `FILE_NOT_FOUND`,
`SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND`, `SCHEMA_INVALID`, `GUIDANCE_NOT_FOUND`, `NO_FILES`,
`VALUES_NOT_FOUND`, `GROUNDED_CONFIG_MISSING`, `GROUNDED_CONFIG_INVALID`.

## File commands

### `dgml file add <path> [--id FILE_ID] [--recursive] [--on-conflict POLICY] [--text-mode MODE] [--dpi N] [--auto-classify [MODE]]`

Add a File. The source is copied into the workspace, hashed, its pages
are rendered to PNGs via `gs` (300 dpi by default — see `--dpi`), and
per-page word boxes are written to `page_text/` according to `--text-mode`.

`<path>` is a `.pdf`, or a convertible source (`.docx`/`.doc`/`.xlsx`/`.xls`)
when a converter is configured for its format family in the workspace
`conversion` config. A convertible source is converted to PDF at add time and
the result is **persisted** alongside the stored original at
`files/<file_id>/<stem>.pdf`; pages are rendered from it and generation reuses
it (the document is converted exactly once). With no converter configured for a
non-PDF format, the add fails with `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE`; there is no default
converter. See [Document conversion](conversion.md).

`<path>` may also be a **directory**, in which case every ingestible file
(`.pdf` plus the convertible source extensions, case-insensitive) in it is
added in a single run — see [Bulk add (a directory)](#bulk-add-a-directory)
below. `--recursive` controls whether subdirectories are walked; it is
ignored when `<path>` is a single file.

`--id FILE_ID` sets the File's id instead of generating one — useful when the id is decided
elsewhere (a tenant id, a source-system document number). It must be **3 to 40 characters
using only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores, and starting with a letter
or digit**. Omit it for a generated
12-character id.

Fails with `CONFLICT` if another File already holds the id with different content, under
every `--on-conflict` policy — except when re-ingesting a revised document under its own
id with `--on-conflict replace`, which keeps it. Re-adding identical content under the
same id is a no-op. Fails with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the id is malformed, if `<path>` is
a directory (one id cannot name many Files), or if `--on-conflict` would return an
existing record that does not carry the requested id.

| `--on-conflict` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `error` (default) | Fail loudly on any conflict. |
| `skip` | Return the existing record; no new record. |
| `replace` | On path-conflict: delete the old record (and its DocSet assignments) and add a new one. On hash-conflict: equivalent to `skip` (content already matches). |
| `duplicate` | Always create a new record, even when an exact duplicate exists. |

| `--text-mode` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `digital` (default) | Extract digital text from the PDF with `pdfminer.six`. A permanent text-extraction error is recorded for files with no digital text — the File record is still created (soft fail). |
| `ocr` | Send each rendered page image to the cloud provider configured in `<workspace>/config.toml`. Requires the `azure` or `aws` extra (`uv sync --extra azure` / `uv sync --extra aws` from a repo checkout; `pip install dgml[azure]`/`dgml[aws]` once DGML is published to PyPI). See "OCR configuration" below. |
| `hybrid` | Run `digital` then `ocr` and merge the two per-page results by grouping words covering the same area into overlap regions (boxes overlap on IoU > 0.5 *or* one mostly contained in the other, so split/merge tokenization is resolved as a unit). Each region is resolved as a whole: OCR-only regions are kept; digital-only regions (no overlapping OCR) are assumed invisible to the human eye and dropped; mixed regions compare both sides' concatenated text by dash-normalized Levenshtein distance — if they agree (distance ≤ 2) digital wins (its characters come straight from the PDF font, more reliable than OCR even when OCR's tokenization is finer), and if they disagree OCR wins. A page whose digital text is mostly unresolved glyphs (pdfminer `(cid:N)` sentinels) falls back to OCR entirely. Default is silent — pass the global `--verbose` flag to surface per-page warnings and the merge summary on stderr. Requires the same `ocr` workspace config as `--text-mode ocr`. Optionally, an LLM can make the per-region decision instead of this heuristic — declare a `text_extraction` section in `config.toml` (e.g. a local Ollama model); see [storage-layout.md](storage-layout.md#text_extraction-optional). Any LLM failure falls back to the heuristic for that page. |

`--dpi N` sets the resolution page images are rasterized at, in dots per
inch (default `300`, must be a positive integer — `0` or a negative value is
an argparse usage error, exit 2, before the workspace is touched). Lower
values roughly linearly reduce render time and `page_images/` disk use: 150
is usually ample for OCR and for the clustering vision encoder, which
downscales anyway. The value is stored on the File as `page_image_dpi`, and
`dgml check --retry-errors` re-renders and re-extracts at that recorded value
rather than the current default, so a repair reproduces the file's existing
geometry.

Note that `--dpi` also governs `page_text/` word boxes, which are expressed
in **page-image pixel space** (`round(pdf_pts * dpi / 72)`) rather than PDF
points — so the coordinates in a File added with `--dpi 150` are half those
of the same File added at 300. Anything consuming `dg:origin` boxes should
read `page_image_dpi` off the File record rather than assuming 300.

Conflict types recorded in the success payload as `conflict_kind`:

- **`hash`** — exact byte-for-byte duplicate of an existing File.
- **`path`** — different content but the same source path
  (`original_path`) as an existing File.
- **`id`** — `--id` named an id another File already holds. Only ever a
  `CONFLICT` error, never a success payload.

The `dgml file add` response also includes:

- `created` — `false` if an existing record was returned instead of creating a new one.
- `note` — human-readable explanation when the policy did something
  surprising (e.g. `replace` on a hash-conflict is a no-op since content is
  already identical).
- `page_render_error` — set if the page renderer failed or rendered a wrong page count.
- `page_count_error` — set if pypdf could not parse the PDF to extract a
  page count. The File record is still created (with `page_count: null`)
  and a permanent error is recorded; consistency check will skip retrying
  unless invoked with `--retry-errors`.
- `text_extraction_error` — set if pdfminer.six failed to parse the PDF or
  the PDF had no extractable digital text on any page. The File record is
  still created and a permanent error is recorded.
- `text_extraction` — summary object on success: `{ mode, pages_written,
  pages_with_words, total_words }`. `null` when extraction itself failed.
- `conversion_error` — set if a convertible source (docx/xlsx/…) could not be
  converted to PDF (missing converter binary/SDK, conversion failure). The
  File record is still created (with `page_count: null`) and a permanent error
  is recorded. `null` for PDFs and successful conversions.
- `classification` — present **only** when `--auto-classify` is passed.
  `decision` is `"existing"` or `"new"` (always `"existing"` under
  `--auto-classify existing`). See "Auto-classification" below.

Error codes that can come back on `file add`:

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `OCR_CONFIG_MISSING` | `--text-mode ocr` or `--text-mode hybrid` but `<workspace>/config.toml` is missing or has no `ocr` section. No record is created. |
| `OCR_CONFIG_INVALID` | `<workspace>/config.toml` has an `ocr` section with invalid fields. No record is created. |
| `TEXT_EXTRACTION_CONFIG_INVALID` | `--text-mode hybrid` but the optional `text_extraction` section in `<workspace>/config.toml` is malformed. No record is created. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE` | Path is not a `.pdf` and is not a convertible source with a converter configured for its format family. |
| `INVALID_PDF` | File does not start with the `%PDF-` magic. |
| `CONVERSION_CONFIG_INVALID` | The `conversion` section of `<workspace>/config.toml` is malformed or names an unresolvable/invalid provider. |
| `CONFLICT` | Hash- or path-conflict and `--on-conflict error`; or `--id <id>` naming an id another File already holds (`conflict_kind: "id"`, under any policy). (Also `workspace create --id <id>` when the store of workspaces already holds that id.) |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | `--id` is malformed, was passed with a directory `<path>`, or cannot be honoured because `--on-conflict` would return an existing record with a different id. |
| `CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG_MISSING` | `--auto-classify` was passed but `<workspace>/config.toml` is missing or has no `classification` section. |
| `CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG_INVALID` | The `classification` section exists but a required field is missing or malformed. |
| `NO_EXISTING_DOCSETS` | `--auto-classify existing` was passed but the workspace has no DocSets to assign to. |

The classification config is a precondition for `--auto-classify`, so a
missing/invalid one is a **hard** error (exit 1) rather than a per-file
soft error — every file would otherwise report the same thing. Having at
least one DocSet is the same kind of precondition for `--auto-classify
existing`, and is treated the same way. For a bulk directory add both are
checked once up front, so the run aborts before any file is added.

Soft-fail codes recorded on the File rather than returned as an envelope (OCR/hybrid-specific):

- `OCR_FAILED` / `AUTH_ERROR` — provider API or credential failure during OCR (also applies to `hybrid` since it runs OCR per page). File record is created with `text_extraction_error` set and a permanent error recorded.

Soft-fail codes surfaced in the `classification.error` field (auto-classify-specific). These cover failures of the classification *call*, after a valid config is in hand — the File record is still created and exit code stays `0`:

- `CLASSIFICATION_FAILED` — the LLM call itself failed (network, malformed response, missing `litellm`, unknown DocSet id, …).
- `AUTH_ERROR` — `classification.api_key_env` names an env var that isn't set.

### Bulk add (a directory)

When `<path>` is a directory, `dgml file add` walks it for ingestible
files, lex-sorts them, and runs the same per-file pipeline on each — one
subprocess, one config load, one DocSet-store read for the whole batch
instead of per file. "Ingestible" means `.pdf` always, plus the convertible
source extensions (`.docx`/`.doc`/`.xlsx`/`.xls`, case-insensitive) **whose
format family has a converter configured** in the workspace `conversion`
config. Convertible sources with no configured converter are skipped, not
gathered — so a folder of PDFs with stray Office docs doesn't produce a pile
of per-file failures. (A malformed `conversion` config aborts the run with
`CONVERSION_CONFIG_INVALID`.) `--recursive` descends into subdirectories; the
default scans the top level only (the `find -maxdepth 1` equivalent).

`--on-conflict`, `--text-mode`, and `--auto-classify` apply per file
exactly as for a single add. `--on-conflict skip` is the recommended
bulk flag — it makes re-runs idempotent. With `--auto-classify`, a
DocSet created for one file becomes visible to the files processed
after it, so similar PDFs in the batch cluster into the same DocSet.
Under `--auto-classify existing` no DocSets are created, so that in-run
growth doesn't happen: every file is assigned within the same curated set
the run started with.

Each file commits independently: a single bad PDF (or a conflict under
`--on-conflict error`) is recorded in its entry and the run continues.
The command exits `0` as long as the run completes — per-file failures
are reported, not raised. Only a run-level abort (workspace not
initialized, directory unreadable) returns a non-zero error envelope.

The payload is a single envelope — the shared batch shape (`summary` count
block + per-item `results`, each carrying a `status`), matching `docset
generate`.

```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/pdfs",
  "recursive": false,
  "summary": {
    "total": 3,
    "added": 1,
    "skipped": 1,
    "soft_failed": 1,
    "hard_failed": 1
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "status": "added",
      "path": "/path/to/pdfs/clean.pdf",
      "file": { "id": "kxlv1o15powg", "...": "..." },
      "created": true,
      "conflict_kind": null,
      "page_render_error": null,
      "page_count_error": null,
      "text_extraction_error": null,
      "conversion_error": null,
      "text_extraction": { "mode": "digital", "...": "..." },
      "note": null
    },
    {
      "status": "hard_failed",
      "path": "/path/to/pdfs/broken.pdf",
      "error": { "code": "INVALID_PDF", "message": "..." }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry's `status` is one of `added` / `skipped` / `soft_failed` /
`hard_failed`, matching the summary buckets. A successful entry otherwise
carries the same fields as a single `file add` response (plus `path`, and
`classification` when `--auto-classify` is set). A hard-failed entry
has `status`, `path`, and an `error` object instead of a `file` record.

`summary` counts (they sum to `total`):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `total` | Ingestible files found (`.pdf` + convertible sources; other extensions are ignored, not counted). |
| `added` | Newly created File records with no recorded soft error. |
| `skipped` | Existing records returned via `--on-conflict skip`/`replace` (`created: false`). |
| `soft_failed` | Added, but with a `page_render_error`, `page_count_error`, `text_extraction_error`, or `conversion_error` recorded. |
| `hard_failed` | The add raised (bad PDF, conflict under `--on-conflict error`, …); the entry carries an `error` object. |

Run `dgml check` afterward as the authoritative health signal for the
whole workspace.

## Auto-classification

`--auto-classify` on `dgml file add` uses a configured vision LLM to look at
the new file's rendered page images and either assign it to an existing
DocSet or create a new one.

The flag takes an optional `MODE`:

| Invocation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--auto-classify` | Same as `existing-or-new` — the historical default. |
| `--auto-classify existing-or-new` | Assign to an existing DocSet if one fits; otherwise create one. |
| `--auto-classify existing` | Always assign to an existing DocSet — the best-fitting one. Never creates a DocSet, and never declines. |

Use `existing` when the workspace's DocSets are curated and an ingest run
must not grow new ones — otherwise one odd file anchors a one-document
DocSet that someone has to notice and clean up.

> **`existing` assumes the files belong.** The LLM is required to return a
> DocSet, so a document whose type isn't represented in the workspace is
> assigned to the closest one anyway rather than flagged. Only pass
> `existing` when you already know each file fits one of the DocSets; for a
> mixed or unknown batch use `existing-or-new`, or `dgml cluster`. With no
> DocSets to choose from the command fails with `NO_EXISTING_DOCSETS`
> (exit 1) instead of guessing.

> **Argument order matters.** `MODE` is optional, so the parser takes the
> *next* token as its value. Put `<path>` **before** the flag —
> `dgml file add doc.pdf --auto-classify` — or name the mode explicitly:
> `dgml file add --auto-classify existing doc.pdf`. Writing
> `dgml file add --auto-classify doc.pdf` exits 2 with
> `invalid choice: 'doc.pdf'`.

Configure the model via the `classification` section in
`<workspace>/config.toml`:

```json
{
  "classification": {
    "model": "gemini/gemini-flash-lite-latest",
    "max_pages": 3,
    "api_key_env": "GEMINI_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | yes | `<provider>/<model>` in [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) form — e.g. `gemini/gemini-flash-lite-latest`, `anthropic/claude-opus-5`, `openai/gpt-4o`. |
| `max_pages` | no (default `3`) | How many rendered page images (`page_images/page_1.png` …) to send to the LLM. Cap is per-classification cost: 1 is the cheap setting, 4+ is the thorough one. |
| `naming_attempts` | no (default `1`) | How many independent proposals to request when naming a *newly clustered* DocSet (`dgml cluster`, not per-file `--auto-classify`). At `1` the single proposal is used as-is. At `2`+ the name the plurality of attempts agreed on wins, and that share is reported as the file's `naming_confidence` — a 3-of-3 agreement is safe to accept unreviewed, a 2-1 split is worth a look. Costs tokens linearly, so raise it only for runs where a wrong DocSet name is expensive to undo. |
| `api_key` | no | Optional literal API key. Use only on per-developer workspaces (config.toml isn't checked in). Mutually exclusive with `api_key_env`. |
| `api_key_env` | no | Optional name of the env var to read the API key from. Mutually exclusive with `api_key`. When neither is set, litellm uses its built-in per-provider lookup (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, …). When `api_key_env` references an unset env var, `AUTH_ERROR` is raised. |

The `litellm` SDK ships in the base install — no extra needed.

The LLM is forced to pick exactly one of two tools:

- `assign_to_existing_docset(docset_id)` — the new file would answer
  the same `key_questions` as one of the existing DocSets above (i.e.
  a single extraction schema would work for both). Topical overlap
  alone is not enough.
- `create_new_docset(name, description, key_questions)` — no existing
  DocSet fits. The LLM proposes a document-type-specific name (e.g.
  "Property Tax Bill", not "Property Tax Records"), a one-sentence
  description, and 3-7 concrete questions the first pages of this
  document type can answer. The `key_questions` are persisted on the
  new DocSet and shown to future classifications.

`--auto-classify existing` offers only `assign_to_existing_docset`, so
with `tool_choice="required"` a choice is forced: the LLM is told a
perfect fit isn't required and to return the closest DocSet. `decision`
is therefore always `"existing"`. A model that calls `create_new_docset`
anyway is refused with `CLASSIFICATION_FAILED`.

Two cases skip the LLM entirely, since neither leaves anything to decide:

- **Exactly one DocSet** — the file is assigned to it, with the same
  payload the model would have returned. This mode creates no DocSets,
  so a whole bulk run over a one-DocSet workspace costs no LLM calls.
  (`existing-or-new` still calls here — it may need a new DocSet.)
- **No DocSets** — the command fails with `NO_EXISTING_DOCSETS`
  (exit 1). Both preconditions (config, and at least one DocSet) are
  checked *before* the file is ingested, single and bulk alike, so a
  failed run adds nothing — erroring after the add would leave behind
  the unassigned file this mode exists to avoid.

Classification runs **after** the file is added, and only when `created`
is `true`. Re-runs on a duplicate (`--on-conflict skip`) skip the LLM
call entirely: `classification.performed` is `false` and the existing
record is returned untouched.

The `classification` payload block:

```json
"classification": {
  "performed": true,
  "model": "gemini/gemini-flash-lite-latest",
  "decision": "existing",
  "docset_id": "k7q3xb91pmrf",
  "docset_created": false,
  "docset_name": "Vendor Invoices",
  "docset_key_questions": [
    "What is the vendor name?",
    "What is the invoice total?",
    "What is the invoice date?"
  ],
  "error": null
}
```

`docset_key_questions` echoes the assigned DocSet's `key_questions`
(empty list for DocSets created without them). When `decision`
is `"new"`, this is the list the LLM just proposed and that has been
persisted on the freshly-created DocSet.

Under `--auto-classify existing` the block looks the same as the
`"existing"` example above; `decision` is never `"new"` and never
anything else, since the assign tool is the only one offered.

When the file already existed (`created: false`):

```json
"classification": {
  "performed": false,
  "reason": "file already existed; classification skipped"
}
```

Classification works even when digital text extraction failed (scanned
PDFs), because it operates on the rendered page images — the same PNGs
the OCR mode uses. It does **not** work when page rendering itself failed
(`page_render_error` set, `page_images/` empty); in that case
`classification.error` is `CLASSIFICATION_FAILED: no page images found …`
and the file is left unassigned.

## OCR configuration

When `--text-mode ocr` is used, the provider and its settings come from
`<workspace>/config.toml`. A workspace is per-developer / not checked
into source control, so secrets *may* live directly in `config.toml`
(`api_key`) — but the safer default is to use `api_key_env` and keep
the key in an environment variable.

### Azure Document Intelligence

```json
{
  "ocr": {
    "provider": "azure",
    "endpoint": "https://<resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
    "api_key_env": "AZURE_DOCINTEL_KEY"
  }
}
```

Auth resolution, in order of precedence:

- `api_key` (optional, literal string) — used verbatim if set.
- `api_key_env` (optional, env var **name**) — env var is read and used.
- Neither set — falls back to `DefaultAzureCredential` (env vars,
  managed identity, `az login`, …).

`api_key` and `api_key_env` are mutually exclusive; setting both yields
`OCR_CONFIG_INVALID`. A referenced-but-unset env var produces
`AUTH_ERROR`.

### AWS Textract

```json
{
  "ocr": {
    "provider": "aws",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "profile": "default"
  }
}
```

- `profile` is **optional**. When omitted, boto3's default credential
  chain is used (env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, IAM role, SSO).
- Textract is invoked once per rendered page image (5 MB sync limit).

## PDF engine configuration

DGML needs two things from a PDF library: rasterizing pages into
`page_images/`, and slicing a page range into a new PDF (the per-window
payload `docset generate` sends to the model). Both come from one
**engine**, selected by the `pdf` section of `<workspace>/config.toml` (or
the user config — the same layered resolution as every other section). With
no section, the system **ghostscript** binary is used, as always. To use
PDFium in-process instead — no system binary needed, `pip install
dgml[pdfium]`:

```toml
[pdf]
provider = "pypdfium2"
```

One key governs both capabilities on purpose: the reason to switch is usually
"don't require a system binary", which is only satisfied when neither
rendering nor slicing shells out.

Valid providers: `ghostscript` (default), `pypdfium2`. An unknown provider or
a stray key yields `PDF_CONFIG_INVALID`. Selecting `pypdfium2` without the
`pdfium` extra installed yields `ENGINE_NOT_AVAILABLE`, recorded as a soft
per-file page-render failure like any other engine error (and as a per-file
`failed` entry during `docset generate`).

The renderer used at add time is recorded on each File
(`page_image_renderer`) and `dgml check --retry-errors` re-renders with the
*recorded* renderer, so repaired pages reproduce the file's existing pixels
(backends differ subtly — anti-aliasing, ±1 px dimension rounding). Changing
the config only affects files added afterwards. PDF page *slicing* is not
Page *slicing* follows the same engine: ghostscript's `pdfwrite` by default,
or PDFium's structural page import when configured. The two are
interchangeable in what a slice contains, but not byte-for-byte — ghostscript
re-encodes images (smaller payloads on scans, lossily), while PDFium copies
them verbatim (higher fidelity, up to ~2x larger). Slices are never persisted
or hashed, so switching engines cannot invalidate an attestation or a cache.

## Managing secrets locally

The CLI reads secrets from environment variables. The lookup path
depends on the feature and is **not** shared across OCR and
classification:

- **OCR — Azure**: reads the env var named by `ocr.api_key_env`. If that
  field is omitted, falls back to the Azure SDK's `DefaultAzureCredential`
  chain (env vars like `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`/`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, managed
  identity, `az login`, …). The classification env vars below are not
  consulted.
- **OCR — AWS**: reads from the boto3 credential chain — `ocr.profile` if
  set, otherwise standard AWS env vars (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, …),
  `~/.aws/credentials`, IAM role, SSO. The classification env vars below
  are not consulted.
- **Classification only**: reads the env var named by
  `classification.api_key_env` if set. If that field is omitted, litellm
  looks up its own per-provider env var based on the `model` prefix —
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` for `gemini/…`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for `openai/…`,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for `anthropic/…`, etc. These provider env vars are
  classification-specific; setting `GEMINI_API_KEY` does nothing for OCR.

The CLI does **not** auto-load a `.env` file. Pick whichever of these
patterns your team already uses to populate the environment:

- **Manual export** (one shell session):
  ```bash
  export AZURE_DOCINTEL_KEY="..."
  uv run dgml file add scan.pdf --text-mode ocr
  ```
- **`direnv`** — drop an `.envrc` in the workspace directory; it loads
  automatically on `cd` and unloads on leave.
- **Sourced env file** — keep a gitignored file of `KEY=value` lines
  (`.env`, `config.env`, `secrets.env` — `source` doesn't care which),
  then:
  ```bash
  set -a; source config.env; set +a
  uv run dgml file add scan.pdf --text-mode ocr
  ```
- **Secret-manager wrappers**:
  ```bash
  op run --env-file=.env -- uv run dgml file add scan.pdf --text-mode ocr   # 1Password
  aws-vault exec my-profile -- uv run dgml file add ...                     # aws-vault
  ```
- **Azure token auth** — omit `api_key_env` from `config.toml` entirely
  and run `az login`. `DefaultAzureCredential` will pick up the session
  with no env vars needed.

The CLI doesn't auto-load `.env` deliberately: doing so would surprise
users about file location and override precedence and would pull in a
dependency. Keeping the contract at "we read `os.environ`" lets teams
plug in whichever workflow they already trust.

### `dgml file list`

### `dgml file show <file_id>`

### `dgml file delete <file_id>`
Removes the File and any DocSet assignments to it. Does not affect other
Files or DocSets.

## DGMLX commands

A **DGMLX bundle** is the Merkle-attested, portable export of a file's
*DGML version* — the set of on-disk artifacts that together constitute
everything DGML knows about it: the source document (a `.pdf`, or the
`.docx`/`.xls`/… it was converted from), one image per page, and — when a
DocSet is named — that DocSet's `full-schema.rnc` (and
`extraction-schema.rnc`, when set) plus the file's
`<stem>.dgml.xml`. `schema.json` itself is not bundled: the RNC render is
lossless over it, so attesting the `.rnc` covers the JSON exchange form. The `dgmlx` commands roll those artifacts up to a single
RFC-6962 Merkle root and package them into a portable,
**filename-independent** bundle.

The per-page text JSONs under `page_text/` (the token files from text
extraction) are an intermediate artifact and are **not** included in the
bundle or its Merkle root.

The bundle's ordering is driven by the `META-INF/dgml-attestation.xml`
attestation file, not by filenames. Each page artifact carries an explicit
`number` attribute; the verifier orders leaves by that number, so the
artifact files inside the bundle can be named anything. The attestation
file is **not** part of the attestation — it only records the relative
paths, the per-page numbers, the rendering provenance, and the Merkle root
so a holder of just the bundle can re-verify it.

Canonical leaf order: source → page images (by `number`) → full schema →
extraction schema → DGML XML. Missing slots are simply absent (a smaller
version), not an error.

#### `META-INF/dgml-attestation.xml` (the attestation file)

This single namespaced file is both the **manifest** (artifact inventory +
ordering) and the **provenance record**. It carries:

- the **Merkle root** (`<merkle-root>`, with the `algorithm` attribute);
- the **workspace identity** — `file-id` (always present) and `docset-id`
  (present only when exported with `--docset`);
- the **rendering provenance** from `file.json` — `page-image-dpi`,
  `page-image-renderer`, and (only for a non-PDF source converted to PDF)
  `pdf-converter`. A field absent from `file.json` is omitted, not emitted
  empty;
- the `<artifacts>` **inventory** — each leaf's role mapped to its relative
  path, with per-page `number` attributes.

These are metadata for attribution and verification — the file itself is
not a leaf of the Merkle root.

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<dgml-attestation xmlns="http://dgml.io/ns/attestation" version="1"
                  page-image-dpi="300" page-image-renderer="ghostscript"
                  pdf-converter="LibreOffice"
                  file-id="f00000000abc" docset-id="ds0000000xyz">
  <merkle-root algorithm="sha256">9f1c…64-hex…</merkle-root>
  <artifacts>
    <source>source/contract.docx</source>
    <page-images>
      <page-image number="1">page_images/page_1.png</page-image>
      <page-image number="2">page_images/page_2.png</page-image>
    </page-images>
    <full-schema>full-schema.rnc</full-schema>
    <dgml-xml>contract.dgml.xml</dgml-xml>
  </artifacts>
</dgml-attestation>
```

The hash algorithm is not user-selectable; `<merkle-root>`'s `algorithm`
attribute records what was used (always `sha256` — both leaf hashes and
Merkle inner nodes). Verification rejects an attestation file recording any
other algorithm (`ATTESTATION_INVALID`), and treats one without the attribute
(written by older versions) as `sha256`.

#### OPC packaging + the `.dgmlx` archive

The bundle is also shaped as an **OPC package** (Open Packaging
Conventions, ECMA-376 Part 2 — the same container family as `.docx`):

- `[Content_Types].xml` (§10.1) — a content-type registry with one
  `<Default>` per extension present (`pdf`/`docx`/…, `png`, `json`,
  `xml`, `rels`). No per-part `<Override>` is needed; an unknown
  extension maps to `application/octet-stream`. This file is not itself a
  part and is not listed inside itself.
- `_rels/.rels` (§9) — the package relationships part. Up to three
  relationships: the **main document**
  (`http://dgml.io/ns/relationships/main-document`) always points at the
  `source/` original; **dgml-xml** (`http://dgml.io/ns/relationships/dgml-xml`)
  points at the generated `<stem>.dgml.xml` when the export is docset-scoped
  and the XML exists; and **attestation**
  (`http://dgml.io/ns/relationships/attestation`) points at
  `META-INF/dgml-attestation.xml` — the verification entry point. Targets
  are percent-encoded, so a source named `My Doc.docx` is referenced as
  `source/My%20Doc.docx`.

The package is zipped into a portable `<stem>.dgmlx` archive (stem = the
source filename's stem) in `<dir>`, with `[Content_Types].xml` as the first
entry. The archive is built from the explicit part list, so it never packs
itself (or a prior run's archive) back in. The OPC parts and the archive
don't participate in the Merkle root.

### `dgml dgmlx export <file_id> --output-dir <dir> [--docset <docset_id>] [--unpacked]`

Attests the file's current artifacts and writes the DGMLX bundle (artifacts
+ `META-INF/dgml-attestation.xml` + `[Content_Types].xml` + `_rels/.rels`).
The two output modes are mutually exclusive:

- **default** — only the `<stem>.dgmlx` archive is written to `<dir>`; the
  bundle is staged in a temp directory and removed after zipping.
- **`--unpacked`** — the loose bundle tree is written into `<dir>` and **no
  archive is produced**.

With `--docset`, the docset-scoped artifacts (`full-schema.rnc`,
`<stem>.dgml.xml`) are included if present; without it, only the file-side
artifacts (source, page images) are attested.

Success payload (exit `0`):

```json
{
  "file_id": "f00000000abc",
  "docset_id": null,
  "output_dir": "/path/to/bundle",
  "dgmlx": "/path/to/bundle/contract.dgmlx",
  "root": "9f1c…64-hex…",
  "slots": ["source", "page_image[1]", "page_image[2]"]
}
```

The payload carries exactly one output path: `dgmlx` (the archive) by
default, or `attestation` (the loose `META-INF/dgml-attestation.xml` path)
with `--unpacked`.

### `dgml dgmlx verify <path>`

`<path>` is either a `.dgmlx` archive or an unpacked bundle directory. An
archive is extracted to a temporary directory first; a directory is read in
place. Either way verify reads `META-INF/dgml-attestation.xml`, re-hashes the
referenced artifacts in canonical order (page ordering from the `number`
attributes, never the filenames), recomputes the Merkle root, and compares it
to the recorded root.

Success payload:

```json
{
  "path": "/path/to/contract.dgmlx",
  "file_id": "f00000000abc",
  "docset_id": null,
  "valid": true,
  "expected_root": "9f1c…",
  "computed_root": "9f1c…",
  "slots": ["source", "page_image[1]", "page_image[2]"]
}
```

Exit codes mirror `dgml check`: `0` when the bundle verifies, `2` when
it verifies-but-fails (a tampered or altered artifact → roots differ,
`valid: false`), and `1` (error envelope, `ATTESTATION_INVALID`) when the
bundle is structurally broken — `<path>` is neither a directory nor a
readable `.dgmlx` archive, a missing/malformed
`META-INF/dgml-attestation.xml`, a referenced artifact absent from disk,
or a bad/duplicate page `number`.

## Node commands

Element-level attestation over a file's generated DGML XML. Every
element of the document is a Merkle leaf (see
[merkle-attestation.md](merkle-attestation.md)); the `node` commands
export the attestation payload for one element — its hash, the
document tree's Merkle root, and the inclusion proof connecting the
two — and later re-verify it. Node attestation is docset-scoped
(`--docset` is required) and reads the same canonical
`docsets/<id>/files/<id>/<stem>.dgml.xml` artifact the DGMLX bundle's
`dgml_xml` slot hashes.

An element is addressed by exactly one coordinate:

- `--leaf <n>` — 0-based DFS pre-order index (the Merkle leaf index).
- `--xpath <expr>` — an XPath matching exactly one element, resolved
  against the document's own namespace prefixes. The UX tree view's
  "Copy XPath" emits a canonical positional form
  (`/dg:chunk/docset:Entry[2]/docset:Amount`).
- `--child-path <path>` — slash-separated 0-based child-element indices
  walked from the document root (e.g. `1/1` = "the root's 2nd child
  element's 2nd child element"), skipping comments/PIs at every level.
  This is the coordinate a DOM tree view naturally has (a browser's
  `Element.children`) when a caller has a node reference but no
  ready-made XPath or leaf index for it. An empty string selects the
  document root.

### `dgml node export <file_id> --docset <docset_id> (--leaf <n> | --xpath <expr> | --child-path <path>)`

Success payload (exit `0`):

```json
{
  "file_id": "f00000000abc",
  "docset_id": "ds0000000xyz",
  "leaf_index": 3,
  "leaf_count": 4,
  "xpath": "/dg:chunk/docset:Entry/docset:Amount",
  "node_hash": "ab12…64-hex…",
  "root_hash": "9f1c…64-hex…",
  "proof": {
    "leaf_hash": "ab12…",
    "leaf_index": 3,
    "leaf_count": 4,
    "path": [{"sibling": "77aa…", "side": "L"}]
  },
  "node_xml": "<docset:Amount xmlns:docset=\"…\">100</docset:Amount>"
}
```

`node_hash` equals `proof.leaf_hash` and is the SHA-256 of `node_xml`'s
UTF-8 bytes (`node_xml` is the element's exclusive-C14N serialization,
so a holder can re-hash it directly). `root_hash` is the Merkle root of
the whole DGML XML tree — the same value the DGMLX bundle records as
the `dgml_xml` slot's leaf hash.

### `dgml node prove <file_id> --docset <docset_id> --proof <path|->`

`--proof` takes a `node export` payload (any JSON object carrying
`root_hash` and `proof`); `-` reads stdin. The element at the proof's
`leaf_index` in the workspace's *current* DGML XML is re-hashed and the
inclusion proof re-walked.

Success payload:

```json
{
  "file_id": "f00000000abc",
  "docset_id": "ds0000000xyz",
  "leaf_index": 3,
  "xpath": "/dg:chunk/docset:Entry/docset:Amount",
  "expected_root": "9f1c…",
  "expected_node_hash": "ab12…",
  "computed_node_hash": "ab12…",
  "valid": true
}
```

On a failed proof, comparing `computed_node_hash` against
`expected_node_hash` distinguishes "this node changed" from "the tree
around it changed". Exit codes mirror `dgml dgmlx verify`: `0` proven,
`2` computed-but-mismatched (`valid: false`), `1` (error envelope) for
structural problems — unknown ids, no generated XML, a malformed proof
payload (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`), or a document so restructured the leaf
index no longer exists.

## Discovery commands

### `dgml discover <file_id> --docset <docset_id> [options]`

Analyse a File's generated DGML XML, group element types by structural role,
and filter them so agents and humans can quickly identify which tag types are
worth staking (via `dgml node export` / `dgml stake node`).

The command works on the grounded DGML XML when available
(`<stem>.dgml.grounded.xml`), falling back to the plain XML.  Each result
entry carries representative element **samples**: the `depth_first` field
is the 0-based DFS pre-order leaf index that `dgml node export --leaf <n>`
accepts directly.

**Flags**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--docset <id>` | required | DocSet the DGML XML was generated in. |
| `--filter <name>` | `all` | Filter to apply; see the filter table below. |
| `--samples N` | `2` | Maximum element samples per tag type. |
| `--include-structural` | off | Include `dg:`-namespace framework elements in results. |
| `--full` | off | Full output: includes `role`, `filters`, `depth_first`, `page`, and XML attributes in each sample. Default strips attributes and omits those fields. |
| `--search <term>` | — | Case-insensitive substring filter on tag names (e.g. `date`, `price`). |
| `--search-content <term>` | — | Case-insensitive substring filter on sample XML text content. |

**Algorithmic filters** (no LLM call, identical results to the HTML app)

| Filter | What it selects |
|---|---|
| `all` | Every non-root tag type in the document (default). |
| `values` | Tags whose instances are mostly leaf text nodes (`role = leaf-value` or `textRatio ≥ 0.5`). Best for staking individual field values. |
| `sections` | Tags with high betweenness or high ancestor coverage — structural section headers. |
| `density` | Information-dense branches: high token-per-depth, high child type variety, or many leaf descendants. |
| `patterns` | Tags with the highest structural entropy — most variable child composition. |

**Semantic filters** (require a generation LLM config in `<workspace>/config.toml`)

| Filter | Selects tags the LLM categorises as … |
|---|---|
| `Who` | Parties, entities, persons. |
| `When` | Dates, durations, periods. |
| `Amounts` | Monetary values, quantities, rates. |
| `Definitions` | Defined terms, glossary entries. |
| `Rules` | Conditions, obligations, prohibitions. |

If the generation LLM config is absent or the call fails and a semantic
filter was requested, `dgml discover` warns on stderr and falls back to
`All` — it does **not** hard-fail.

**Success output (exit 0)**

```json
{
  "file_id": "f00000000abc",
  "docset_id": "ds0000000xyz",
  "filter": "values",
  "tag_count": 2,
  "tags": [
    {
      "tag": "LiabilityCap",
      "count": 1,
      "role": "leaf-value",
      "filters": ["values"],
      "samples": [
        {
          "depth_first": 5,
          "xpath": "/dg:chunk/docset:IndemnificationClause/docset:LiabilityCap",
          "page": 2,
          "xml": "<docset:LiabilityCap xsi:type=\"decimal\" dg:value=\"500000\" dg:origin=\"2 460 410 1800 455\">$500,000</docset:LiabilityCap>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field notes**

- `role` — `"leaf-value"` | `"container"` | `"hybrid"` | `"mixed"` (same
  roles as the HTML app).
- `filters` — all algorithmic filters the tag would pass (useful when
  `--filter all` is used and you want to know a tag's category).
- `samples[].depth_first` — pass directly to `dgml node export --leaf <n>`
  to get the attestation payload for that specific element.
- `samples[].page` — first token of the element's `dg:origin` attribute
  (the page number); `null` when no origin is present (ungrounded XML).
- `samples[].xml` — the element serialized as XML with namespace
  declarations stripped (for display; not the canonical C14N form).

**Error codes**

`FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `DOCSET_NOT_FOUND`, `NOT_FOUND` (no generated DGML XML),
`INVALID_ARGUMENT` (bad filter name or empty ids).

## Chain attestation commands

Anchor a DGMLX bundle's Merkle root, or a single node's hash, directly
on an EVM chain — no MCP server. These commands require the `chain`
extra (`uv sync --extra chain` from a repo checkout; `pip install
dgml[chain]` once DGML is published to PyPI); without it they return a
`MISSING_EXTRA` error envelope. The local Merkle/hashing is identical to
the `dgmlx`/`node` commands; these add the chain transport (a stdlib
JSON-RPC client, anchor-precompile ABI encoding, EIP-1559 signing).

The anchored checksum, URI, and metadata are **public on-chain** —
never put document content in them. Node records expose only hashes.

**Configuration & key handling**

- `--chain <name>` selects a configured chain (env `NVNM_CHAIN`,
  default `nvnm-testnet`). `nvnm-testnet` and `nvnm-mainnet` are
  built-in; add others with `dgml chain add`.
- `--registry <name>` is the registry **name** on the chain (env
  `NVNM_REGISTRY`). Create one with `dgml registry create`.
- `--from <addr>` is the sender EVM address (env `NVNM_FROM_ADDRESS`);
  it defaults to the address controlled by the keyring key.
- The signing key lives in the OS keyring (service `nvnm-wallet`,
  account `default`; override with `NVNM_KEY_SERVICE` /
  `NVNM_KEY_ACCOUNT`). It is never read except at signing time and never
  printed. Signing refuses if the key does not control `--from`.
- Write commands (`stake`, `registry create`) build, sign, **and
  broadcast** by default; `--dry-run` stops after signing and emits the
  unsigned + signed transaction for review without spending gas.
  `--legacy` uses a type-0 transaction instead of EIP-1559.

### `dgml chain {list,show,add,remove}`

Manage chain configs. Custom chains persist to a JSON file resolved
`--chain-config` → `$DGML_CHAINS` → `<workspace>/chains.json`. Built-in
chains cannot be removed or redefined.

```bash
dgml chain list
dgml chain show nvnm-testnet
dgml chain add --name local --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --chain-id 1337 \
  [--anchor-address 0x…] [--explorer https://…] [--native-token TOKEN]
dgml chain remove local
```

A chain entry: `{name, rpc_url, chain_id, anchor_address, explorer?,
native_token?, builtin}`.

### `dgml wallet status --chain <name> [--address <addr>]`

Read-only balance + pending nonce. `--address` defaults to the keyring
key's address. Payload: `{chain, address, balance_wei, balance_eth,
native_token, nonce, funded}`.

### `dgml registry {create,list} --chain <name>`

```bash
dgml registry create --chain nvnm-testnet --name my-registry \
  --description "…" [--metadata '{}'] [--from 0x…] [--dry-run] [--legacy]
dgml registry list --chain nvnm-testnet [--name my-registry]
```

`create` anchors a new registry (the creator becomes its admin) and on
success returns `{chain, registry, from, tx_hash, broadcast,
receipt_status, block_number, explorer_url}`. `list` decodes the
on-chain `registries` view.

### `dgml stake file <file_id> [--docset <id>] [--unpacked] --chain <name> --registry <name>`

Export the file's DGMLX bundle, anchor its Merkle root as the record
checksum (URI `dgmlx://<file_id>[/<docset_id>]`), broadcast, await the
receipt, then fetch and save the anchored record to `record.json` in the
output dir. Success payload includes `checksum` (the Merkle root),
`uri`, `tx_hash`, `receipt_status`, `record`, `record_path`,
`explorer_url`, and `bundle_dir` (the output directory). By default the
bundle is written as a single portable `<stem>.dgmlx` archive whose path
is reported in `dgmlx`; pass `--unpacked` to write the loose bundle tree
instead, in which case the payload reports the loose attestation-file path
in `attestation` (and no `dgmlx`). `--output-dir` overrides the output
location (default `<workspace>/dgmlx-bundles/<ids>`); the archive (or loose
tree) and `record.json` are written there.

The saved record path is reported in `record_path`; keep it for offline
proving. Bundle records save as `record.json`; node records save as
`record-node-<leaf>.json` so a file's bundle and its nodes never clobber
each other in the shared output dir.

### `dgml stake node <file_id> --docset <id> (--leaf <n> | --xpath <expr>) --chain <name> --registry <name>`

Anchor one DGML XML element: the record checksum is the node hash and
the metadata carries `{kind: "dgml-node", root_hash, proof}` (the URI
gains a `#<leaf>` fragment). Same broadcast/confirm/save flow as `stake
file`.

### `dgml prove {file,node} --chain <name> (--registry <name> --checksum <hex> | --record-json <path|->)`

Re-verify an anchored record against the current workspace. Supply the
record either by looking it up on-chain (`--registry` + `--checksum`) or
from a saved `--record-json` (`-` for stdin). `prove file` re-exports
the bundle and compares the recomputed Merkle root to the anchored
checksum; `prove node` re-hashes the element and re-walks its proof
against the recorded root. Exit codes mirror `dgmlx verify`: `0` proven,
`2` mismatch (`valid: false`), `1` for structural errors.

## Error code reference

Every value the CLI can put in an `error.code` field, plus the soft-fail
codes it records on a File (surfaced in `dgml check` and in `file add`
payload fields like `text_extraction_error`, never in a top-level `error`
envelope). **Hard** = emitted as the stderr `error` envelope with exit `1`;
**soft** = recorded/returned in a payload field, exit unaffected.

| Code | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WORKSPACE_NOT_INITIALIZED` | hard | A command that needs a workspace ran against a directory that has no workspace **config** — which is what makes a directory a workspace, since the config names the storage backend and cannot be reconstructed. This covers both "never a workspace" and "a workspace whose `config.toml` was deleted"; nothing on disk distinguishes them for a remote-backed workspace, so one error carries all the remedies. The message names the resolved path and offers remedies that work against *that* workspace: `dgml workspace create <path> --organization <org>` to make one there, `dgml workspace list` to find one you already have, or restoring the config from backup. (It deliberately does not say a bare `dgml workspace create`, which would create a workspace elsewhere and leave the command failing identically.) |
| `LEGACY_CONFIG_PRESENT` | hard | A pre-migration `<workspace>/config.toml` is the only config present; the format is now TOML. Run `dgml init` to write `~/.config/dgml/config.toml`, then migrate any settings. |
| `MODELS_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The `[models]` tier block is malformed (a tier is set to a non-string / empty value). |
| `MISSING_EXTRA` | hard | A command needs an optional extra that isn't installed (e.g. `dgml[clustering]`). |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | hard | An argument is malformed or empty (e.g. blank `file_id`, unreadable `--proof`, a `file add --id` that is malformed, passed with a directory, or unsatisfiable under the chosen `--on-conflict`). |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | hard | Unexpected exception; the message is a short, single-line `<ExcType>: <msg>` (capped, whitespace collapsed). Pass `--verbose` (or set `DGML_DEBUG=1`) for the full stderr traceback. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | hard | Generic not-found (base for the specific codes below). |
| `DOCSET_NOT_FOUND` | hard | No DocSet with the given id. |
| `FILE_NOT_FOUND` | hard / soft | A File id, assignment, or source is missing. Soft as a per-item `results` entry in `docset generate`/`ground`. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE` | hard | `file add` path is neither a PDF nor a convertible source. |
| `INVALID_PDF` | hard | File does not start with the `%PDF-` magic. |
| `CONFLICT` | hard | Hash- or path-conflict under `--on-conflict error`; `file add --id <id>` naming an id another File already holds; or `workspace create --id <id>` naming an id the store of workspaces already holds. |
| `CONVERSION_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The `conversion` config section is malformed. |
| `CONVERSION_FAILED` | hard / soft | A docx/xlsx→PDF conversion failed (soft as `conversion_error` on a bulk add entry). |
| `OCR_CONFIG_MISSING` | hard | `--text-mode ocr`/`hybrid` with no `ocr` config section. |
| `OCR_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The `ocr` config section has invalid fields. |
| `OCR_FAILED` | soft | Provider API failure during `--text-mode ocr`/`hybrid`; recorded on the File (`text_extraction_error`). |
| `TEXT_EXTRACTION_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The optional `text_extraction` (hybrid-merge) config is malformed. |
| `STYLE_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The optional `style` (image-based `dg:style` for OCR files) config section is malformed; fails `generate` up front. |
| `AUTH_ERROR` | hard / soft | A referenced API-key env var is unset (soft in `classification.error`). |
| `MODEL_NOT_SUPPORTED` | hard | A configured model id isn't recognized by litellm (misspelling, wrong/absent `provider/` prefix, or unavailable in this litellm version). Checked up front for every LLM call; skipped when that section's `api_base` is set (custom endpoint). |
| `CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG_MISSING` | hard | `--auto-classify` with no `classification` config. |
| `CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The `classification` config has a missing/invalid field. |
| `CLASSIFICATION_FAILED` | soft | The classification LLM call failed; lands in `classification.error`. |
| `NO_EXISTING_DOCSETS` | hard | `--auto-classify existing` in a workspace with no DocSets to assign to. |
| `CLUSTERING_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The optional `clustering` config section failed validation. |
| `GROUNDING_FAILED` | soft | Grounding a file failed; surfaces as `grounded: false` with a `grounding_error` on that file's `docset generate` result entry. |
| `LABEL_MODEL_UNREACHABLE` | soft | A file's labeling could not reach the `label_model` at all (auth / bad model id / network); surfaces as a `label_error` on that file's `docset generate` result entry. The file still converts, unlabeled. |
| `GENERATION_FAILED` | soft | `docset generate` produced no output for a file (transcription failed) or two files shared a filename; per-item `failed` entry in `results`. |
| `SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND` | hard | An `extraction` command needs an `extraction-schema.rnc` the DocSet doesn't have. |
| `SCHEMA_INVALID` | hard | A schema passed to `extraction set-schema` is not valid RNC (within the supported subset) or not a JSON object. |
| `NO_FILES` | hard | `extraction generate-schema` has no sample files (empty DocSet and no `--from-file`). |
| `VALUES_NOT_FOUND` | hard | `extraction get-values` ran before `extraction extract` for that file. |
| `GROUNDED_CONFIG_MISSING` | hard | An `extraction` command needs a `grounded` config section that is absent. |
| `GROUNDED_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The `grounded` config section has a missing/invalid field. |
| `SCHEMA_GENERATION_FAILED` | hard | The schema-generation LLM call failed or returned a non-object. |
| `VALUES_EXTRACTION_FAILED` | hard | The value-extraction pipeline failed. |
| `CHAIN_CONFIG` | hard | A chain config is missing/invalid, or `dgml chain add/remove` hit a bad/built-in chain. |
| `CHAIN_RPC` | hard | A JSON-RPC call to the chain failed (network, bad RPC URL, node error). |
| `CHAIN_TX_REVERTED` | hard | A broadcast `stake`/`registry create` transaction reverted on-chain. |
| `WALLET_KEY_MISSING` | hard | No signing key in the OS keyring, or it doesn't control `--from`. |
| `RECORD_NOT_FOUND` | hard | `prove` could not find the anchored record (bad checksum/registry). |
| `MANIFEST_INVALID` | hard | A `dgmlx verify` bundle is structurally broken (missing/duplicate page number, absent artifact). |
| `ENGINE_NOT_AVAILABLE` | soft | The configured PDF engine cannot run (e.g. `pypdfium2` without the `pdfium` extra installed); recorded as a page-render failure, or a per-file `failed` entry when it was slicing. |
| `GHOSTSCRIPT_NOT_FOUND` | soft | The ghostscript binary (`gs`, or `gswin64c`/`gswin32c` on Windows) is not on `PATH` (an `ENGINE_NOT_AVAILABLE` subtype); recorded as a page-render failure. |
| `PAGE_RENDER_FAILED` | soft | The page renderer failed to render a page; recorded on the File (`page_render_error`). |
| `PDF_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The `pdf` config section is malformed (unknown provider or stray key). |
| `PDF_SLICE_FAILED` | soft | A PDF page-slice operation failed during generation (bad page range, or a backend error). |
| `TEXT_EXTRACTION_FAILED` | soft | pdfminer.six extracted no digital text; recorded (`text_extraction_error`). |
| `CORRUPT_METADATA` | hard / soft | A `file.json`/`docset.json` is not valid JSON (also reported by `dgml check`). |
| `STORAGE_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | A `[storage]` / `[storage.<name>]` table is malformed, or `--storage NAME` names a service that isn't configured. (A workspace with **no** config reports `WORKSPACE_NOT_INITIALIZED` instead — having a config is what being a workspace means.) |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER_UNRESOLVABLE` | hard | A storage `provider` dotted path (`module:Class`) can't be imported/resolved. |
| `WORKSPACES_CONFIG_INVALID` | hard | The `[workspaces]` table is malformed, or its provider was handed an option it does not accept. |
| `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND` | hard | `--workspace <id>` named something the store of workspaces does not hold and that is not an existing directory either. Deliberately an error rather than falling through to path resolution: with both places looked in and neither answering, the likeliest explanation is a typo'd id, and resolving to a path would turn that typo into a new directory. |
| `WORKSPACES_WRITE_CONFLICT` | hard | Another writer changed this workspace's `config.toml` since it was read. A config is written whole, so overwriting would discard whatever that writer changed; re-run the command to work from the current config. Only backends that make writes conditional on the stored text (Mongo) can report this; the local-dir store has one writer per machine and does not. |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND_MISMATCH` | hard | The `[storage]` configuration a workspace resolves no longer matches the `storage_fingerprint` sealed in its `config.toml` — its data is on the previously sealed backend. Accept the change with `dgml workspace reseal <root>`, or restore the `[storage]` table. |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | hard | A requested mode/path is not implemented. |
| `DGML_ERROR` | hard | Generic base code; specific codes above are preferred. |

Codes that read as soft above are the same identifiers, just delivered in a
payload field instead of the `error` envelope — see the `dgml check` section
for the workspace-health view and the `dgml file add` section for the
per-file soft-fail fields.

## System requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Ghostscript (`gs`) — the default PDF engine, installed system-wide for
  page-image rendering and page slicing. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for the
  licensing rationale (ghostscript is AGPL but invoked as a subprocess; it is
  not bundled with `dgml`). **Optional:** `pip install dgml[pdfium]` plus
  `[pdf] provider = "pypdfium2"` uses PDFium in-process for both operations,
  removing the system-binary requirement entirely (see
  [PDF engine configuration](#pdf-engine-configuration)).

## Examples for an LLM agent

Add a file, capture its ID, assign it to a docset:

```bash
dgml init
ds=$(dgml docset create --name "Q2 contracts" | jq -r .id)
fid=$(dgml file add /tmp/example.pdf | jq -r .file.id)
dgml docset add-file "$fid" --docset "$ds"
```

Add a file and let the LLM pick (or create) the right DocSet:

```bash
dgml init
# Assumes <workspace>/config.toml has a `classification` section and
# GEMINI_API_KEY (or the env var named in `classification.api_key_env`)
# is set in this shell.
payload=$(dgml file add /tmp/example.pdf --auto-classify)
ds=$(jq -r .classification.docset_id <<<"$payload")
created=$(jq -r .classification.docset_created <<<"$payload")
echo "assigned to docset $ds (newly created: $created)"
```

Bulk-add a directory of PDFs and assign each to one DocSet:

```bash
dgml init
ds=$(dgml docset create --name "Imported PDFs" | jq -r .id)
payload=$(dgml file add /path/to/pdfs --on-conflict skip)   # one call, one envelope
for fid in $(jq -r '.results[] | select(.file) | .file.id' <<<"$payload"); do
  dgml docset add-file "$fid" --docset "$ds"
done
echo "summary:"; jq .summary <<<"$payload"
```

Recover from a failed batch import:

```bash
dgml check                 # see what's broken
dgml check --retry-errors  # try the failed render(s) again
```
