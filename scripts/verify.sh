# Run the same checks CI does (.github/workflows/ci.yml), locally, in one
# shot. Stops on the first failure. Run before `git push` to avoid the
# round-trip of pushing, watching CI fail, fixing, and pushing again.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify.sh              # run everything CI runs
#   scripts/verify.sh --no-sync    # skip `uv sync` (faster repeats, but
#                                  # only safe if you haven't touched
#                                  # pyproject.toml or uv.lock)
#   scripts/verify.sh --fast       # skip pytest and license-audit
#                                  # (fast feedback loop on lint/format/types)
