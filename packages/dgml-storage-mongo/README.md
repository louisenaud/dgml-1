# dgml-storage-mongo — sample blob + document stores

**A sample, not a supported product.** It exists to prove the DGML storage
abstraction holds on a backend that is not local disk, and to serve as a
reference for anyone writing their own.

| provider | role | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MongoDocStore` | documents | manifests, assignments, extraction stats, the usage log — one collection each |
| `MongoGridFSBlobStore` | blobs | a GridFS bucket |
| `MongoGridFSStore` | both | the two above, on one database |
| `MongoWorkspacesStore` | the *list of* workspaces | one document per workspace, holding its `config.toml` |

`MongoDocStore` is a near-direct delegation: `DocStore` was modelled on the
MongoDB collection API, so nearly every method is one line. The blob store has
actual work to do — see [Blobs in a document database](#blobs-in-a-document-database).

Note that per-page text is a **blob**, not a document: it lives under
`files/<id>/page_text/` and is read through the blob store.

## Use it

```toml
# <workspace>/config.toml — everything on Mongo (the flat form: one provider for
# both roles, which is only possible because MongoGridFSStore implements both).
[storage.default]
provider = "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoGridFSStore"
mongo_host = "localhost"
mongo_database = "dgml_dev"
mongo_bucket = "acme_blobs"   # optional, default "blobs"
```

Or mix, per role:

```toml
# <workspace>/config.toml — S3 blobs + Mongo docs
[storage.default.blobs]
provider = "dgml_storage_s3:S3BlobStore"
bucket = "dgml-dev"
endpoint_url = "http://localhost:9000"

[storage.default.docs]
provider = "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoDocStore"
mongo_host = "localhost"
mongo_database = "dgml_dev"
```

Omit a role's subtable to leave it on local disk.

| option | required | default |
|---|---|---|
| `mongo_database` | yes | — |
| `mongo_host` | no | `localhost` |
| `mongo_port` | no | `27017` |
| `mongo_bucket` | no | `blobs` — blob stores only |

## The list of workspaces

`MongoWorkspacesStore` is a different kind of thing from the three above. Those hold
**one workspace's data**; this holds **the set of workspaces a machine can open**, and
each one's `config.toml`. Point two machines at one database and they share one list —
`dgml --workspace ws_…` opens the same workspace on a laptop and in CI, with no config
file passed between them.

```toml
# ~/.config/dgml/config.toml — the USER config, not a workspace's
[workspaces]
provider = "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoWorkspacesStore"
mongo_host = "localhost"
mongo_database = "dgml_workspaces"
mongo_collection = "dgml_workspaces"   # optional
```

Read only from the user config: this store is what *finds* a workspace, so a workspace
cannot be allowed to redefine it. `[workspaces]` in a workspace's own `config.toml` is
ignored.

One document per workspace, `_id` = its `workspace_id`:

```javascript
{
  _id:         "ws_7qxdm2pjk3n5rwts",
  config_toml: "…verbatim UTF-8 text…",   // AUTHORITATIVE
  config_sha256: "9f86d081…",              // ↓ derived, regenerated on every write
  name:         "Acme Contracts",          //   config_sha256 is the CAS predicate
  organization: "acme",
  storage_service: "bym",
  created_at: "2026-08-26T18:04:11Z",
  updated_at: ISODate(…),
  schema_version: 1
}
```

**The config is one verbatim string, not parsed sub-documents** — and not because
parsing would be inconvenient. It does not work: TOML's bare local date
(`d = 2026-01-01`) parses to a `datetime.date`, which BSON refuses to encode at all,
and an offset datetime comes back with microseconds truncated and the zone normalized.
Both are legal in a `[generation]` or `[ocr]` override, so a parsed-BSON store would
**reject a valid config.toml**. Beyond that, dgml owns no TOML *writer* to round-trip
back through (`workspace_config._toml_value` raises rather than guess), nothing queries
inside a config, and text is what keeps the promise that a user's comments and key
order survive a write *identically on both backends*. A comment that survives on local
disk and vanishes here is exactly the defect class this package exists to surface.

The scalar fields are a **projection**, regenerated from the text on every write by
shared base-class code so the two backends cannot describe a workspace differently.
`dgml workspace list` is then one query with `config_toml` excluded. Deliberately *not*
projected: `storage_fingerprint`, because a queryable copy of a seal invites comparing
against the copy instead of the thing; and any path, because where a workspace's files
sit is per-machine and a shared column recording it is the mistake the old
`workspaces.json` index made.

### Why this store detects conflicts and the local one does not

A config is written **read-modify-write over the whole text**. So a lost update here
does not drop the field being written — it discards the other machine's `[storage]`
table, `[models]` edits and comments, and the result still parses. The old per-machine
index tolerated interleaved writes because its rows were a cache; that argument does not
transfer to authority.

Every write is therefore conditional on the content the writer read, and the predicate is
**`config_sha256`, not the text**: the document is replaced only if the stored config still
hashes to what was read, otherwise `WORKSPACES_WRITE_CONFLICT` rather than an overwrite.
The local backend passes `expected_text` too and ignores it — one writer per machine by
construction.

The main reason is the collation caveat below: two distinct lowercase hex digests differ in
real characters, so no collation can fold them together. Hashing makes that structural
rather than something whoever creates the collection has to know.

There is a confidentiality argument too, and it is **narrower than it looks**.
`storage_resolve` does support third-party providers carrying an inline credential in
`config.toml` (that is what `_SECRET_HINTS` is for), so a config may hold a secret, and a
hashed filter keeps it out of query-*shape* telemetry — `$queryStats`, `explain`,
plan-cache keys. It does **not** keep the config out of `system.profile`, `db.currentOp()`
or the slow-query log: those capture the whole command, and the `$set` payload still
carries the text. Measured with `db.setProfilingLevel(2)` over five profiled updates: 0/5
filters held config text, 3/5 update payloads did. So this removes one of two copies from
those sinks, not the exposure — worth knowing before anyone relies on it.

The write filter also shrinks from a whole config to 64 bytes: real, minor.

There is deliberately **no `revision` counter**. It would be a second source of truth to
keep in step with the field that already answers the question, and the reason the
interface once carried one — a backend is handed the read and the write as separate
calls, so no transaction spans them — is not fixed by making the token an integer. Two
consequences fall out, both wanted: rewriting identical text succeeds instead of
conflicting, and an A→B→A sequence does not conflict, because the stored state is what
was read.

`updated_at` is for humans and ordering only and must **never** be the predicate — see
the GridFS notes below on what millisecond-resolution timestamps do to a comparison.
Comparing content has no such tie: two different texts are two different strings.

The hash is a projection like the rest of `_derive` — a pure function of the authority,
verifiable from it, regenerated on every write — so "never read as authority" survives the
predicate reading it. It cannot drift the way a counter can, because nothing updates
`config_toml` through this store without recomputing it.

Historical note, now defused: when the predicate was the text, a collection created with a
case- or accent-insensitive default `collation` would have made it match text that differs.
Still don't give this collection a collation, but that is hygiene rather than the load-bearing
requirement it was.

### Reachability

Every command needs the configured Mongo to be reachable. For `mongo_host = "localhost"`
that means "is mongod running", which fails immediately and obviously. For a managed
cluster it means `dgml workspace list` fails off-VPN. There is deliberately **no cache
of the config text**: it names the storage backend, so serving a stale copy could open a
workspace against the wrong backend and write there silently — and the seal cannot catch
that, because the fingerprint lives inside the config, so a stale config and its own
stale fingerprint agree perfectly.

## Credentials

**Never put credentials in DGML config.** Mongo reads `DGML_MONGO_URI` if set (the
full connection string, including any credentials); otherwise it connects to
`mongo_host:mongo_port` with no auth. All four providers share this, and it
accepts any URI pymongo does — `mongodb+srv://…`, auth, TLS — so a managed
cluster is only a different address.

This is not stylistic. `dgml_core.storage_resolve` decides what is a secret by
**substring match on the option name** (`key`, `secret`, `token`, `password`,
`credential`); anything else is persisted to the workspace's plaintext `config.toml`. An
option named `mongo_uri` holding `mongodb://admin:hunter2@host` matches none of
them, so the password would be written out in the clear.

`MongoWorkspacesStore` checks `DGML_WORKSPACES_MONGO_URI` first, then falls back to
`DGML_MONGO_URI`. Two variables rather than one because a URI is used verbatim, before a
database is selected, so a single one cannot express both a workspace's data credentials
and the workspaces store's — which matters because that collection holds every
workspace's storage bindings, i.e. a map of your infrastructure, and Mongo's roles are
per-database. Keep it in its own database.

Note that the "config is likely committed or synced" argument does not apply to
`[workspaces]`, since it lives in the user's own config. The conclusion is unchanged
anyway: `_SECRET_HINTS` is *fingerprint* machinery and nothing hashes these options, so
an inline URI would buy no protection at all — it would simply be a password in a file.

## Blobs in a document database

MongoDB caps a BSON document at 16 MB and a source PDF has no size bound, so a
blob has to span documents. That is exactly what GridFS specifies, so this store
delegates to it rather than hand-rolling a chunk layout — which also means the
bytes are readable by any official MongoDB driver, and that download streams
seek, so a large artifact can be served by byte range.

The collections are the spec's: **`<bucket>.files`** (one document per revision —
`filename`, `length`, `chunkSize`, `uploadDate`, `metadata`) and
**`<bucket>.chunks`** (`files_id`, `n`, `data`). Neither collides with a
`dgml_core.layout.Collection` member, which is what lets blobs and documents
share one database.

The blob key is the GridFS `filename`. Chunks are 1 MiB rather than the 255 KiB
GridFS default: at 255 KiB a 300 DPI page image is a dozen documents, and page
images are the bulk of a workspace.

### Revisions — the one real friction

GridFS addresses a blob by `filename` **plus** `uploadDate`; a `BlobStore`
addresses it by key alone. Reconciling those is the substance of this class, and
both halves are measured rather than assumed:

1. **GridFS versions instead of replacing.** `upload_from_stream(name, …)` generates a
   new file id and leaves the prior revision in place. So `put_blob` captures the
   prior revision ids before uploading and deletes them after, and `list_blobs`
   de-duplicates across revisions. A port that forgets either grows one revision
   per re-render, forever.
2. **Revision order is ambiguous at millisecond resolution.** `revision=-1` means
   "most recent by `uploadDate`", and `uploadDate` has millisecond precision. Two
   writes to one key inside the same millisecond leave the ordering genuinely
   undefined — and the failure mode is a *silent stale read*. This is not
   theoretical: writing a key twice in a row and reading it back returns the
   **first** revision, both carrying an identical `uploadDate`. (Observed under
   `mongomock`; the tie is in the data rather than the fake, so a real server is
   equally entitled to pick either — "undefined" is the problem, not which side
   you land on.)

So `open_download_stream_by_name` is deliberately **never called**. Reads resolve
the revision explicitly and break the `uploadDate` tie on `_id`. That narrows the
ambiguity to two processes writing one key inside the same second rather than
closing it — `ObjectId` is monotonic within a process, not across them. DGML
never has two writers on one key (`staged_write` regenerates a whole prefix from
one process), so it is sound for the pipeline; keep it in mind before pointing
two writers at one workspace.

Ordering the write as *upload, then collect the old revision* gives the same
"authoritative record dies last" property as the cascade contract on
`delete_blobs`: a crash leaves an orphaned revision (recoverable) rather than a
key with no bytes behind it.

**Torn reads are retried, not raised.** GridFS reports a collected revision as
`CorruptGridFile`; this store re-resolves and converges on the current bytes
rather than handing that exception to a caller mid-pipeline.

### `sha256_blob` is a lookup, not a download

The digest is computed at write time and stored in GridFS `metadata`, so hashing
a blob is one indexed document read. This is the one place this backend beats an
object store: attestation over a 200-page file becomes 200 index hits instead of
200 downloads, and on S3 there is no shortcut — the multipart ETag and composite
`ChecksumSHA256` are checksums-of-checksums and explicitly not the value the
`BlobStore` contract requires.

`test_composed.py` pins that shortcut to the contract: the same artifacts must
produce the same attestation Merkle root on Mongo and on local disk.

## If you adapt this for production

Blobs generally belong in an object store. Honest trade-off:

| | Mongo blobs | S3 blobs |
|---|---|---|
| `sha256_blob` | one indexed read ✅ | full re-read of the object |
| Storage cost | roughly 10× S3 per GB | the cheap option ✅ |
| Replication | every page image flows through the oplog to every secondary | none of your business ✅ |
| Overwrite | revision flip + retry-on-torn-read | atomic, read-after-write ✅ |
| Operational surface | one backend, one credential ✅ | a second service to run |
| Presigned URLs, lifecycle tiering | none | ✅ |
| Ranged reads | ✅ | ✅ |

Page images are the bulk of a workspace, the most regenerable bytes in it, and
the least query-worthy — paying database prices and oplog bandwidth for them is
the main thing to think twice about. The `sha256_blob` win is real but separable:
you can cache digests in the *document* store at write time and keep blobs on S3.

Also unbuilt here: no compression, and orphaned revisions from an interrupted
write are never swept (a periodic job reconciling `<bucket>.files` against what
`list_blobs` reports would do it).

### What sharing a database does *not* buy you

Atomic cascades. With both halves in one database a transaction spanning a
document delete and its blob deletes is theoretically available — but `BlobStore`
and `DocStore` expose no transaction handle, and `delete_blobs` is documented to
run last precisely because cross-store atomicity is assumed impossible. Capturing
it would take an interface change in `dgml-core`, not a provider.

### What the flat form *does* buy you

One instance. Both roles resolve to the same config, so `Workspace` constructs the
provider once and serves `blobs` and `docs` from it — a flat-form workspace holds a
single `MongoClient`, not one per role. This keys off the resolved config rather than
the syntax, so two per-role subtables naming the same database and options collapse
the same way.

## Run the tests

```bash
docker compose -f packages/dgml-storage-mongo/docker-compose.yml up -d
DGML_TEST_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017 uv run pytest packages/dgml-storage-mongo
```

With that variable unset the suite still runs, against in-process `mongomock` — so
it never silently skips. No ghostscript or PDF library is needed either; the
composed tests place artifacts directly.

**One trap if you touch this package.** `mongomock` does not drive `GridFSBucket`
under current `pymongo` out of the box: `mongomock.MongoClient` has no `.options`
property, so GridFSBucket's `db.client.options.timeout` falls through mongomock's
attribute-style database accessor and `_timeout` becomes a `Collection`, tripping
pymongo's timeout wrapper on first upload. The `_mongomock_gridfs` fixture in
`tests/conftest.py` closes that in three lines. The reason it matters: the
original failure *leaks a context variable* before raising, so subsequent GridFS
calls start passing and a suite can look green on the strength of one poisoned
test. **Check GridFS tests individually as well as in a batch.**

## Licences

| component | licence | how used |
|---|---|---|
| `pymongo` | Apache-2.0 | dependency of this package ✅ (`gridfs` ships inside it — nothing extra) |
| `mongomock` | ISC | dev/test only ✅ |
| MongoDB Community | SSPL | dev/CI container, never redistributed |

The root `CLAUDE.md` bans SSPL for **Python packages shipped inside the wheel**.
The MongoDB server is a network service we invoke, not code we ship — the same
reasoning that already permits ghostscript. `pip-licenses` will not flag it, which
is why it is written down here. [FerretDB](https://ferretdb.com) (Apache-2.0)
speaks the MongoDB wire protocol and is a drop-in for the compose file if the SSPL
question ever becomes live; `pymongo` talks to both unchanged. That holds for the
blob store too — GridFS is a client-side convention over ordinary collections,
with no server-side feature behind it.
