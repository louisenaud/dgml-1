"""A whole workspace on MongoDB — blobs *and* documents, via ``MongoGridFSStore``.

The contract tests cover each role in isolation; these cover the composition:
that the resolver's flat form wires one class into both roles, that blobs and
documents keep out of each other's way in a shared database, and — the one that
matters most — that a file's attestation root does not depend on which backend
the workspace happens to live on.

Deliberately free of ghostscript and any PDF library: artifacts are placed
directly, so the suite runs the same everywhere rather than skipping.
