"""The list of workspaces in MongoDB.

Three things are worth testing here and the rest follows from them:

1. **Parity.** A workspace must be described identically whichever backend lists it.
   The derived listing fields are computed in the base class precisely so that is
   structural, and the fidelity test below is what proves the config text itself
   survives a round trip byte-for-byte, which the local backend also promises.
2. **Lost updates.** A config is written whole, so an overwrite discards the other
   writer's `[storage]` table and comments — not just the field being written. That is
   why this backend makes every write conditional on the content it read — via
   `config_sha256` rather than the text, so no collection `collation` can fold two configs
   together — and the local one does not.
3. **The representation.** `config_toml` must stay a single string. A future
   "let's just parse it into BSON" refactor has to fail loudly here rather than quietly
   start dropping comments and rejecting valid TOML dates.
