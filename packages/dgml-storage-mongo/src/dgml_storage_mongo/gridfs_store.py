"""A sample :class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.BlobStore`: blobs via **GridFS**.

Blobs live in a GridFS bucket, via the ``gridfs`` module that ships inside
``pymongo`` — there is nothing extra to install. GridFS exists to get past the
16 MB BSON document cap, which a source PDF has every right to exceed.

Delegating to the spec rather than hand-rolling a chunk layout buys two things:

- **Cross-driver interoperability.** GridFS is a spec every official MongoDB
  driver implements identically, so a Node or Go service can read blobs this
  store wrote.
- **Ranged reads.** GridFS download streams seek, so a large artifact can be
  served by byte range without materializing it. Nothing in the DGML pipeline
  asks for that today, but a service in front of a workspace might.

It costs the revision bookkeeping in :ref:`the note below <gridfs-revisions>`,
which is the substance of this class.

Layout
------

Standard GridFS, so the collections are the spec's: ``<bucket>.files`` (one
document per revision, holding ``filename``, ``length``, ``chunkSize``,
``uploadDate``, ``metadata``) and ``<bucket>.chunks`` (``files_id``, ``n``,
``data``). Default bucket name ``blobs``, so ``blobs.files`` /
``blobs.chunks`` — neither collides with a
:class:`~dgml_core.layout.Collection` member, so blobs and documents can share
one database.

The blob key is the GridFS ``filename``. ``sha256`` is written into
``metadata`` at upload time, which keeps :meth:`sha256_blob` a single indexed
read here too.

.. _gridfs-revisions:

Revisions, and why reads do not use ``open_download_stream_by_name``
-------------------------------------------------------------------

GridFS addresses a blob by ``filename`` **plus** ``uploadDate``; a
``BlobStore`` addresses it by key alone. Reconciling the two is the whole
substance of this class:

``upload_from_stream`` *versions* — it generates a new file id and leaves the prior
revision in place. So :meth:`put_blob` captures the prior revision ids before
uploading and deletes them after. That imposes replace semantics, and orders the
write so the new bytes land complete before the old are collected: a crash
leaves an orphaned revision (recoverable) rather than a key with no bytes
behind it.

``open_download_stream_by_name`` is deliberately **not** used. Its ``revision``
parameter is defined against ``uploadDate``, which is millisecond resolution:
two writes to one key inside the same millisecond carry an identical
``uploadDate``, leaving ``revision=-1`` ("the most recent") genuinely undefined
— and the failure mode is a silent stale read. Reads here resolve the revision
explicitly and break a tie on ``_id`` instead, then stream by file id.

That narrows the window rather than closing it: ``_id`` (an ``ObjectId``) is
monotonic within a process but not across processes writing in the same second.
DGML never has two writers on one key — ``staged_write`` regenerates a whole
prefix from a single process — so this is sound for the pipeline. It is,
however, the one place this backend is weaker than a store keyed by the blob key
alone, where no ordering question exists at all. Worth remembering before
pointing two writers at one workspace.

Torn reads are retried, not raised: GridFS reports a collected revision as
``CorruptGridFile``, and this store re-resolves and converges on the current
bytes rather than handing that exception to a caller mid-pipeline.
