"""A sample :class:`~dgml_core.workspaces_store.WorkspacesStore`: the list of
workspaces in MongoDB.

This is the payoff of making the list pluggable: point two machines at one database
and they see one set of workspaces. ``dgml --workspace ws_…`` opens the same workspace
on a laptop and in CI, with no config file passed between them::

    # ~/.config/dgml/config.toml
    [workspaces]
    provider = "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoWorkspacesStore"
    mongo_host = "localhost"
    mongo_database = "dgml_workspaces"

One document per workspace, ``_id`` = its ``workspace_id``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      _id:         "ws_7qxdm2pjk3n5rwts",
      config_toml: "…verbatim UTF-8 text…",   // AUTHORITATIVE
      config_sha256: "9f86d081…",              // ↓ derived, regenerated on every write
      name:         "Acme Contracts",          //   config_sha256 is the CAS predicate
      organization: "acme",
      storage_service: "bym",
      created_at: "2026-08-26T18:04:11Z",
      updated_at: ISODate(…),
      schema_version: 1
    }

Why the config is one **verbatim text** field
---------------------------------------------

Not because parsing it would be inconvenient — because it does not work. Checked
against ``bson``: TOML's bare local date (``d = 2026-01-01``) parses to a
``datetime.date``, which BSON refuses to encode at all, and an offset datetime comes
back with microseconds truncated and the zone normalized to UTC. Both are legal in a
``[generation]`` or ``[ocr]`` override, so a parsed-BSON store would **reject a valid
config.toml**, failing at write time far from the line that caused it.

Beyond that: this repo owns no TOML *writer* to round-trip back through —
``dgml_core.workspace_config._toml_value`` deliberately raises rather than guess —
nothing anywhere queries inside a config (every reader takes a whole table), and text
is what keeps ``workspace_config``'s promise that a user's comments and key order
survive a write *identical on both backends*. A comment that survives on local disk
and vanishes here is exactly the class of defect this package exists to surface.

Derived fields and why they are safe
------------------------------------

``name``, ``organization``, ``storage_service`` and ``created_at`` are duplicated out
of the config so ``dgml workspace list`` is one query instead of N parses. They are
regenerated from the text on **every** write, in the base class, so the two backends
cannot render a workspace differently. Nothing reads them as authority.

Deliberately *not* denormalized: ``storage_fingerprint``. It is the seal, and a
queryable copy of a seal is an invitation to compare against the copy instead of the
thing. Also no path of any kind — where a workspace's files sit is per-machine, and a
shared column recording it is precisely the mistake the per-machine JSON index made.

Lost updates, and why this one needs a CAS
------------------------------------------

``write_identity`` and ``reseal`` are read-modify-write over the *whole* config text.
So a lost update here does not drop the field being written — it discards the other
machine's ``[storage]`` table, ``[models]`` edits and comments, and the result still
parses. The old per-machine index tolerated interleaved writes because its rows were a
cache; that argument does not transfer to authority.

So every write is conditional on the content the writer read. There is deliberately no
``revision`` counter: it would be a second source of truth to keep in step with the field
that already answers the question, and the reason the interface once needed one — that a
backend is handed the read and the write as separate calls — is not fixed by making the
token an integer.

The predicate is ``config_sha256``, **not the text**. The strongest reason is that it
makes the collation hazard *structural* rather than documented: two distinct lowercase hex
digests differ in real characters, so no case- or accent-insensitive collection
``collation`` can fold them together. A text predicate could only warn about that, and the
warning had to be obeyed by whoever created the collection.

There is a confidentiality argument too, but it is **narrower than it first appears, and
worth stating accurately** because the obvious version of it is wrong. ``storage_resolve``
does support third-party providers carrying an inline credential in ``config.toml`` (that
is what its ``_SECRET_HINTS`` list is for), so a config may hold a secret — and a hashed
filter does keep it out of query-*shape* telemetry: ``$queryStats``, ``explain`` output,
plan-cache keys. What it does **not** do is keep the config out of ``system.profile``,
``db.currentOp()`` or the slow-query log: those capture the whole command, and the ``$set``
payload still carries the text. Measured with ``db.setProfilingLevel(2)`` over five
profiled updates: 0/5 filters contained config text, 3/5 update payloads did. So this
removes one of two copies from those sinks, not the exposure.

The write filter also shrinks from a whole config to 64 bytes, which is a real but minor
saving.

The hash is a projection like the rest of ``_derive``: a pure function of the authority,
verifiable from it, regenerated on every write. That is what keeps "never read as
authority" intact even though the predicate reads it — it cannot drift the way a counter
can, because nothing can update ``config_toml`` through this store without recomputing it.

``updated_at`` is for humans and ordering only and must **never** be the predicate — this
package already contains the case study for why, in ``gridfs_store``'s notes on
millisecond ``uploadDate`` ties, where two writes inside one millisecond leave the
ordering undefined and the failure mode is a *silent stale read*. A digest has no such
tie: two different texts are two different digests.

Credentials
-----------

``$DGML_WORKSPACES_MONGO_URI``, else ``$DGML_MONGO_URI``, else
``mongo_host``:``mongo_port`` unauthenticated. Never a config key, even though this
config lives in the user's own ``~/.config/dgml/config.toml`` rather than beside a
workspace: ``dgml_core.storage_resolve``'s secret-name filter is *fingerprint*
machinery and nothing hashes these options, so an inline URI would buy no protection
whatsoever — it would simply be a password in a file. And ``~/.config`` is arguably
*more* likely to be synced between machines than a workspace directory, which is the
very scenario a shared list of workspaces exists for.
