"""A sample :class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.DocStore`: documents in MongoDB.

DGML documents (file and docset manifests, assignments, extraction stats, the
usage log) live in MongoDB collections — the collection API ``DocStore`` was
modelled on, so nearly every method is a one-line delegation. A reference to
copy, not a tuned production store. Pair it with a
:class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.BlobStore`: ``dgml-storage-s3``, the bundled
local store, or this package's own
:class:`~dgml_storage_mongo.gridfs_store.MongoGridFSBlobStore` (see
:class:`~dgml_storage_mongo.MongoGridFSStore` for both roles at once).

Note that per-page text is a **blob**, not a document — it lives under
``files/<id>/page_text/`` and is read through the blob store.

**Sample, not supported.** Resolved by dotted path like any third party's own::

    [storage.acme.docs]
    provider = "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoDocStore"
    mongo_host = "localhost"
    mongo_database = "dgml_dev"

Credentials
-----------

**Credentials are read from the environment, never from DGML config.** Mongo
reads ``DGML_MONGO_URI`` if set (the full connection string, including any
credentials); otherwise it connects to ``mongo_host``:``mongo_port`` with no
auth. Config carries *identity only* — host, port, database.

There is deliberately no username/password config key: a half-credential in
config (a username with no way to supply the password) builds a URI pymongo
rejects, and an inline password would sit in the workspace's plaintext
``config.toml`` — which now lives beside the workspace and is likely to be committed
or synced. ``dgml_core.storage_resolve`` only treats option names matching
``("key", "secret", "token", "password", "credential")`` as secrets, and ``mongo_uri``
matches none of them.
