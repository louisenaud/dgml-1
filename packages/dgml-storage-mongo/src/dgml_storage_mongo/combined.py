"""Both storage roles on one MongoDB database.

The resolver's **flat form** is one ``[storage.<name>]`` table whose single
top-level ``provider`` serves blobs *and* documents::

    [storage.acme]
    provider       = "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoGridFSStore"
    mongo_database = "dgml_dev"

One database holds both: blobs in GridFS's ``<bucket>.files`` /
``<bucket>.chunks``, documents in collections named for
:class:`~dgml_core.layout.Collection` members. The names cannot collide, which
is what makes sharing a database safe.

The flat form gives you one *instance* as well as one class: both roles resolve
to the same config, so ``Workspace`` builds the provider once and serves
``blobs`` and ``docs`` from it — one ``MongoClient`` per workspace, not one per
role.

What this does **not** buy you: atomic cascades. Both halves living in one
database makes a transaction spanning a document delete and its blob deletes
*theoretically* available, but ``BlobStore`` and ``DocStore`` expose no
transaction handle, and ``delete_blobs`` is documented to run last precisely
because cross-store atomicity is assumed impossible. Capturing it would take an
interface change in ``dgml-core``, not a provider.
