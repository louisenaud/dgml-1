"""Manifold-aware clustering helpers used by S1-style scenarios.

Four clustering algorithms are exposed, all fully manifold-aware:

- :func:`manifold_kmeans` — Riemannian Lloyd's algorithm. Requires a
  user-supplied ``k``. For Euclidean geometry the result is identical to
  standard k-means; for Spherical / Hyperbolic / Product we use the
  manifold's pairwise distance for assignment and the manifold's
  :meth:`expmap0` / Fréchet-mean approximation for the centroid update.
- :func:`manifold_hdbscan` — density-based, *parameter-free* with respect
  to ``k``. Builds the full manifold pairwise-distance matrix and runs
  scikit-learn's HDBSCAN with ``metric='precomputed'``, so the density
  estimate respects manifold geometry rather than ambient Euclidean
  distance. Noise points get label ``-1``; cluster representatives are
  on-manifold medoids (actual data points, so trivially valid on any
  manifold).
- :func:`manifold_graph_cc` — similarity-graph → radius-graph →
  connected-components. Equivalent to single-linkage agglomerative
  clustering cut at distance ``r``, but expressed in graph terms so it
  composes cleanly with sparse-graph backends if we ever need to scale.
  Two auto-radius heuristics are built in: the canonical DBSCAN k-NN
  knee (Ester et al. 1996, with Kneedle-style knee detection) and an
  MST max-gap cut. CCs smaller than ``min_cluster_size`` get label
  ``-1`` to match HDBSCAN's noise convention.
- :func:`manifold_leiden` — Louvain community detection (Blondel et al.
  2008) via networkx (BSD). Builds a weighted graph from the manifold
  distances — k-NN by default, with mutual-k-NN and radius-graph variants
  — then partitions it by modularity. Cluster count emerges from the
  partition. Communities smaller than ``min_cluster_size`` are folded into
  the noise bucket, matching the HDBSCAN convention. (Named 'leiden' for the
  algorithm family, but implemented with networkx's Louvain — the GPL
  leidenalg/igraph backend can't ship in an Apache-2.0-licensed package.)

The high-level :func:`cluster_embeddings` dispatcher picks between the
four based on the ``algorithm`` string (the same enum used in
``ScenarioConfig.cluster_algorithm``), keeping S1 / S2 callers algorithm-
agnostic.

This module also owns :func:`assign_to_prototypes`, the nearest-prototype
classifier used by S2 / S3 / S4 / S5 — including the three composable
gating modes (absolute distance, softmax confidence, and quantile
auto-calibration) for routing out-of-distribution documents to the
"unknown" bucket.

    """Reduce ``embeddings`` to ``n_components`` dims before clustering.

    Density-based clustering (HDBSCAN especially) degrades badly on raw
    transformer embeddings: in hundreds of dimensions pairwise distances
    concentrate into a narrow band, the density estimate flattens, and
    HDBSCAN routes nearly everything to the noise bucket. The standard
    remedy — used by BERTopic and most embedding-clustering pipelines — is
    to project to a low-dimensional space first.

    Methods (all unsupervised; everything but ``umap`` ships with
    scikit-learn, already a dependency):

    - ``"none"`` — passthrough.
    - ``"pca"`` — linear, fast, deterministic. The dependency-free baseline.
    - ``"truncated_svd"`` — PCA without mean-centering; near-identical for
      dense normalized embeddings, mainly a win on sparse input.
    - ``"random_projection"`` — Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss projection.
      No fitting, approximately distance-preserving, extremely fast.
    - ``"kernel_pca"`` — nonlinear PCA with a cosine kernel (suited to
      L2-normalized embeddings); deterministic.
    - ``"isomap"`` / ``"lle"`` / ``"spectral"`` — classic nonlinear manifold
      learners (Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, Laplacian Eigenmaps).
      Neighbour-graph based; slower but capture local manifold structure.
    - ``"umap"`` — the gold standard partner for HDBSCAN (cosine metric).
      Requires ``umap-learn``.

    Args:
        embeddings: ``[N, D]`` input vectors (typically on-manifold /
            L2-normalized).
        method: One of the reducers above.
        n_components: Target dimensionality. Clamped to ``[1, min(N-1, D)]``.
            ``<= 0`` or ``>= D`` is a passthrough.
        seed: Reproducibility seed (ignored by the few estimators that are
            already deterministic, e.g. Isomap).

    1. **Similarity graph.** Compute the full pairwise manifold-distance

       speaking we work with distances rather than similarities; "similarity
       graph" is the colloquial framing — the geometry is identical and
       inverting to similarities adds no information.)
    2. **Radius graph.** Threshold ``D <= r`` to keep only short edges.
       The radius ``r`` is either supplied explicitly via ``radius=`` or
       auto-determined (see below).
    3. **Connected components.** Run union-find / BFS over the radius
       graph; every connected subgraph becomes a cluster. Components of
       size below ``min_cluster_size`` are folded into the noise bucket
       (label ``-1``), mirroring HDBSCAN's behaviour and the convention
       the rest of the scenarios already expect.

    Auto-radius determination (when ``radius`` is ``None``):

    - ``r_method="knee"`` (default): The canonical DBSCAN heuristic
      (Ester et al. 1996). For each point compute its ``k_neighbors``-th
      nearest-neighbour distance; sort the resulting N-vector ascending;
      pick the knee via Kneedle-style perpendicular distance from the
      chord. ``k_neighbors=4`` is the DBSCAN paper's recommendation for
      2-D data and is a reasonable default in higher dimensions; raise
      it for noisier corpora.
    - ``r_method="mst_gap"``: Build the minimum spanning tree of the
      distance matrix, sort its edge weights ascending, find the largest
      consecutive gap, and use the gap's lower endpoint as ``r``. Cleaner
      theoretical interpretation (single-linkage cut at maximum
      separation) but more sensitive to outliers that introduce large
      MST edges.

    Args:
        embeddings: ``[N, D]`` on-manifold points.
        manifold: Active manifold head — supplies ``pairwise_dist``.
        radius: Explicit radius. Overrides ``r_method`` when given.
            Manifold-unit-dependent (radians on sphere, Poincaré units
            in hyperbolic space, …).
        r_method: Auto-radius heuristic when ``radius`` is ``None``.
        k_neighbors: ``k`` for the ``knee`` heuristic. Ignored for
            ``mst_gap``. Clamped to ``[1, N-1]`` internally.
        min_cluster_size: Smallest CC that survives as a real cluster.
            Default ``2`` folds isolated points (size-1 CCs) into noise.
            Set to ``1`` to keep every CC, including singletons, as its

    Backed by networkx's Louvain partitioner (BSD-3) — the
    modularity-optimization predecessor of Leiden, with very similar
    partitions on the graphs built here. (The GPL ``leidenalg`` +
    ``python-igraph`` Leiden backend can't ship in this package's Apache-2.0
    license.) The function name and the ``"leiden"`` algorithm selector name
    the algorithm family. Three graph-construction modes feed into the same
    partitioner:

    - ``graph_method="knn"`` (default): for each point connect to its
      ``k_neighbors`` nearest neighbours in manifold distance. The
      adjacency is symmetrized (edges from both endpoints' k-NN lists
      are unioned) so the partitioning sees an undirected graph.
    - ``graph_method="mutual_knn"``: keep an edge only when both
      endpoints have each other in their k-NN list. Strictly fewer
      edges than ``knn`` — less prone to bridging weak clusters, more
      likely to leave true outliers as isolated singletons.
    - ``graph_method="radius"``: same radius-graph construction used
      by :func:`manifold_graph_cc`, with the same auto-radius
      heuristics (``knee`` / ``mst_gap``). Use when you want Leiden's
      partitioning quality on top of an interpretable distance cutoff.

    Edge weights are Gaussian RBF on manifold distance:
    ``w = exp(-d^2 / (2*sigma^2))`` with ``sigma`` the median edge distance —
    scale-free in the manifold's distance units, so the same ``resolution``
    has roughly the same effect across Euclidean / Spherical / Hyperbolic
    setups.

    Quality functions:

    - ``quality="modularity"`` (default): Reichardt-Bornholdt modularity,
      which is the classical Newman-Girvan modularity at ``resolution=1.0``
      but lets higher values produce smaller, finer-grained clusters. This
      is exactly what networkx's Louvain optimizes via its ``resolution``
      (gamma) parameter. Has a well-known resolution limit on very large
      graphs.
    - ``quality="cpm"``: the Constant Potts Model has no networkx Louvain
      equivalent, so it is approximated by the same resolution-scaled
      modularity optimization as ``"modularity"``. Retained for API
      compatibility; prefer ``"modularity"`` unless you have a specific
      reason and have retuned ``resolution`` for your graph density.

    Communities smaller than ``min_cluster_size`` are folded into the
    noise bucket (label ``-1``), matching HDBSCAN's convention. Cluster
    representatives are on-manifold medoids per surviving community.

    Args:
        embeddings: ``[N, D]`` on-manifold points.
        manifold: Active manifold head — supplies ``pairwise_dist``.
        graph_method: How to build the graph (see above).
        k_neighbors: ``k`` for the (mutual-)k-NN graphs. Ignored when
            ``graph_method="radius"``. Clamped to ``[1, N-1]``.
        radius: Explicit radius for the ``radius`` graph mode. If
            ``None``, auto-pick via ``r_method``. Ignored for k-NN
            modes.
        r_method: Auto-radius heuristic for the ``radius`` mode.
        quality: Optimisation objective (see above).
        resolution: Resolution parameter — higher ⇒ more, smaller
            communities. ``1.0`` matches classical modularity.
        min_cluster_size: Smallest community kept as a real cluster;
            anything smaller goes to noise.
        seed: Reproducibility seed for Louvain's randomized moves.
        n_iterations: Cap on Louvain aggregation passes (maps to
            networkx's ``max_level``). ``-1`` = run until convergence
            (networkx default — no cap).

    """Per-point ordinal confidence for an unsupervised clustering.

    Every algorithm in :func:`cluster_embeddings` returns
    ``(labels, centroids)`` where the centroids are cluster representatives
    on the manifold — true Fréchet-mean centroids for ``kmeans`` /
    ``meanshift`` and on-manifold *medoids* for the density / graph
    algorithms (``hdbscan``, ``graph_cc``, ``leiden``, ``dbscan``,
    ``optics``, ``affinity_propagation``). This turns that geometry into a
    single per-document confidence signal so the unsupervised (S1) path
    stops handing downstream consumers a column of ``None``.

    The signal is the **peak of the softmax over negative manifold distances
    to the centroids** — identical in form to the nearest-prototype
    confidence :func:`assign_to_prototypes` already produces for S2-S5, so
    "confidence" means the same thing across every scenario. Concretely, for
    a document with distances ``d_1..d_C`` to the ``C`` centroids,
    ``confidence = max_j softmax(-d / temperature)_j``. A document that sits
    much closer to one centroid than the rest scores near ``1``; one that is
    roughly equidistant from several scores near ``1/C``. This is exactly the
    medoid-margin reading the roadmap calls for on the centroid methods, and
    a boundary ("border") reading on the density / graph methods — a point on
    a cluster's edge is closer to being reassigned, so its peak softmax is
    lower.

    **Noise points** (``labels[i] == -1``, emitted by every density / graph
    algorithm for low-density regions) are the algorithm's own statement that
    the document does not belong to any cluster, so they are pinned to
    ``0.0`` regardless of geometry — the honest floor of the scale.

    The score is deliberately *ordinal*, not a calibrated probability:
    softmax temperature is a free scale and the medoid geometry is only a
    proxy for HDBSCAN's native membership / GLOSH scores. Temperature/Platt
    scaling and conformal coverage guarantees are a separate, heavier layer
    (they belong with the calibrated-confidence work, not here). What this
    buys today is a real, monotone, per-document signal the novelty gate and
    any consolidation / review step can threshold on instead of a null.

    Args:
        embeddings: ``[N, D]`` points, in the *same* space the clustering ran
            in (i.e. the reduced Euclidean space when a reducer is active, so
            distances line up with the returned ``centroids``).
        labels: ``[N]`` integer cluster ids as returned by
            :func:`cluster_embeddings` (``-1`` = noise).
        centroids: ``[C, D]`` cluster representatives (may be empty when the
            algorithm routed everything to noise).
        manifold: Active manifold head for the clustering space — supplies
            ``pairwise_dist``.
        temperature: Softmax temperature (> 0). Larger values flatten the
            distribution (lower, more conservative confidences); the default
            ``1.0`` matches :func:`assign_to_prototypes`.

    Returns:
        Length-``N`` list of confidences in ``[0, 1]``. Noise points are
        ``0.0``; when there are no centroids at all every point is ``0.0``.
        Typed ``float | None`` to slot directly into
        :attr:`~clustering.scenarios.base.ScenarioResult.confidence`, but in
        practice every entry is a concrete float.
