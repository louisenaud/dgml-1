"""S1 — fully unsupervised clustering.

No labels, no category names. We embed the whole corpus, then run a
manifold-aware clustering algorithm to discover groups. Two algorithms
are supported via :class:`ScenarioConfig.cluster_algorithm`:

- ``kmeans`` (default): Riemannian Lloyd's algorithm; requires
  ``k_clusters``. Predictions are ``cluster_<i>`` for ``i = 0..k-1``.
- ``hdbscan``: density-based, parameter-free in ``k``. The cluster
  count emerges from data density; noise points are routed to a
  ``cluster_noise`` bucket. ``k_clusters`` is ignored when set.

Trainable projector
-------------------
When ``training.epochs > 0`` and the projector has trainable parameters,
S1 trains the manifold projector *before* the unsupervised clustering
step. There are two ways to drive that training:

**Loss-driven (strict S1, label-free).** When ``training.loss`` is one of
the unsupervised losses (``pseudo_label`` / ``knn_contrastive`` /
``cross_modal``), the projector trains with NO access to labels — not even
folder names — and this takes priority over ``training.supervision``.
``pseudo_label`` alternates Riemannian k-means pseudo-labels (optionally
Sinkhorn-balanced) against a prototypical loss (DeepCluster/PCL-style EM);
``knn_contrastive`` is SCAN-style neighbor consistency with an entropy
anti-collapse regularizer; ``cross_modal`` aligns the text-only and
image-only fused views of each document with InfoNCE. Any of them can
carry an additive VICReg variance/covariance penalty.

**Supervision-driven.** Otherwise ``training.supervision`` picks
the signal:

- ``"labels"`` (default): ground-truth labels carried on the records
  (e.g. subfolder names — the ones NMI / ARI are computed against).
  Semi-supervised cluster discovery: labels shape the geometry, but the
  cluster count and assignments are still discovered, not dictated.
  Skipped when no labels are available.
- ``"pseudo_labels"``: fully label-free, DeepCluster-style. Cluster the
  current projection with manifold k-means, treat cluster ids as labels,
  train, optionally re-cluster and repeat (``training.pseudo_rounds``).
- ``"cross_modal"``: fully label-free, CLIP-style. A document's
  text-only and image-only fused views are positives under symmetric
  InfoNCE; all other documents are negatives.

In every mode, inference below remains label-free; the training signal
only shapes the embedding space.

The cascade can later rename clusters via :meth:`Scenario.refine` once
a human assigns category names.
