"""Config system — Hydra config groups validated through pydantic schemas.

The Hydra config groups under ``configs/`` produce ``OmegaConf`` ``DictConfig``
objects at run time. ``resolve()`` validates them into typed pydantic models
so the rest of the code gets type safety + IDE support, and computes the
deterministic ``run_id`` used by the loggers and parquet artifacts.
