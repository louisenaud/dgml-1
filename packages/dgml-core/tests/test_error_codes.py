"""The error-code registry and its documentation must not drift apart.

An `error.code` is part of the CLI's public contract, so a code that exists in
neither place it should is a real defect: an undocumented code leaves callers
branching on an identifier nothing describes, and a documented code with no
class is either a phantom (the class was renamed and the row stayed) or a
string literal somebody will later fail to find.

Both directions had drifted before these tests existed — eight class codes were
undocumented, and `MANIFEST_INVALID` was documented for a path that had raised
`ATTESTATION_INVALID` for some time.
