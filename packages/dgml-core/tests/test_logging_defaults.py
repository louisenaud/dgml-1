"""The library's logging contract, checked from outside the process.

In-process tests cannot verify the *default-silence* half of the contract:
pytest always attaches its own capturing handlers to the root logger, which
keeps Python's last-resort stderr handler from ever firing — so an in-process
assertion on empty stderr would pass even without the ``NullHandler`` in
``dgml_core/__init__.py``. A subprocess with no logging configured is the
production condition.
