"""The workspace's own ``config.toml``: identity block, storage binding, and seal.

Two properties carry most of the weight here and are worth stating up front, because
the rest of the file is mostly their consequences:

1. **Identity does not layer.** The ``[workspace]`` block is read straight from the
   workspace's file, never through the merged-config loader — otherwise a stray key in
   the user-level config would apply to every workspace on the machine.
2. **Storage does not layer either.** A service the workspace defines itself is used
   whole. This is what makes a workspace self-describing, and what keeps a user-config
   edit from silently moving another workspace's data.
