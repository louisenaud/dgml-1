"""Workspace-backed :class:`DocumentDataset` implementations.

Bridges between dgml's per-file storage layout and the clustering
package's dataset contract. The clustering scenarios only consume
``__len__`` / ``__getitem__`` over :class:`DocumentRecord` s; concrete
sourcing (folder Corpus, workspace file IDs, …) is the dataset class's
job.

    that subtree is all that has to exist locally. ``files/<id>/`` also holds the
    source document and every rendered page image — the bulk of a workspace, and
    nothing this reader opens. Materializing the whole prefix is free on
    ``LocalStore`` and a full per-record download on every other backend; the page
    images in it would also duplicate the ones ``__getitem__`` already fetched
    individually.

    Which pages ``text_view`` needs is :func:`dgml_core.utils.page_text_keys`'s
    call — shared with :func:`dgml_core.clustering._corpus_dir`, which does the

    The first-page image for each file comes from the pre-rendered
    ``<file>/page_images/page_1.png`` that ``dgml file add`` produced —
    no re-rendering happens at cluster time. ``text`` is assembled from
    the file's ``page_text/`` JSON under ``text_view`` (the same word-box
    → text logic the eval corpus uses); pass ``text_view`` to match the
    view the configured text encoder expects. Constructing the dataset
    reads nothing; image *and* text loading happen lazily in
    ``__getitem__``.

    ``labels`` is an optional ``{file_id: category}`` map used to build
    labeled support sets for the few-shot scenarios (S3 / S5). When
    omitted, every record's ``label`` is ``None`` — the right default
    for the unassigned-file (unknown) dataset.

    Callers are expected to filter file IDs whose page images are
    missing *before* handing the list here — :func:`dgml.clustering.clustering_internal`
    does this and routes the missing ones into ``failed_file_ids``.
