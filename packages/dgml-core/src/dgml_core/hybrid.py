"""Hybrid text extraction: run digital + OCR and merge by bounding-box overlap.

The output JSON shape matches :func:`dgml.text_extraction.extract_text_digital`
and :func:`dgml.ocr.extract_text_ocr` so downstream code (``dgml check``,
consumers) doesn't care which mode produced the text.

Merge rules (per page, applied to word bounding boxes):

- **Scan guard**: if the page's content is one full-page raster image
  (see :data:`RASTER_PAGE_COVERAGE`), the page is a *picture* of a
  document. Any digital text on it was baked in by whoever scanned it —
  a previous OCR pass, not the document's own character codes — so the
  premise the mixed-region rule rests on ("digital comes straight from
  the PDF font") does not hold, and neither does its geometry: a baked
  layer sits where that scanner *thought* the ink was. We log a "scan
  guard" note and use OCR for the entire page.
- **CID guard**: if digital text has more than
  :data:`MAX_CID_WORDS_PER_PAGE` words containing ``"(cid:"`` — i.e.
  pdfminer couldn't resolve glyphs to Unicode — we treat the whole page's
  digital output as garbage, log a "unicode error", and use OCR for the
  entire page.
- Otherwise, group digital + OCR words that cover the same region into
  **regions** (connected components over a "boxes overlap" graph; see
  :func:`_boxes_overlap`, which matches on IoU *or* containment so a
  merged box and the split boxes it contains land in one region). Each
  region is resolved as a unit, so split / merge tokenization — one side
  splitting a span the other keeps whole — is one decision instead of
  per-word matching:

    * OCR-only region (no digital) → keep OCR; log it.
    * Digital-only region (no OCR) → assumed invisible to the human eye
      (white-on-white, off-page, hidden form layer, …) and **dropped**
      with a warning.
    * Mixed region → concatenate each side's text in reading order and
      compute the (dash-normalized) Levenshtein distance:

        - within :data:`LEVENSHTEIN_THRESHOLD` → the two agree on content,
          so keep **digital** — its character codes come straight from the
          PDF font, which is more reliable than OCR even when OCR's
          tokenization is finer.
        - beyond the threshold → the texts disagree, so take **OCR** (the
          authority on what's actually visible) and warn.

Text comparison folds dash-family code points (PDFs love U+2212 / en-dash
where OCR returns ASCII hyphen) via :func:`_normalize_for_compare`, but the
stored word keeps its original characters.

**LLM-driven merge (optional).** When the workspace declares a
``text_extraction`` section (see :mod:`dgml.text_extraction_config`), the
per-region decision is delegated to that LLM instead of the Levenshtein
rule above. The decision tree changes to:

- digital-only region → dropped (no LLM call, as before);
- OCR-only region → keep OCR (no LLM call);
- mixed region whose digital and OCR token sequences are *identical*
  (dash-normalized) → keep digital (no LLM call);
- every other (differing) mixed region → sent to the LLM, which returns the
  final token list (take digital / take OCR / a combination).

A page's to-decide regions go out in batches of :data:`MERGE_BATCH_SIZE`
regions per call (one page-sized call can overrun the model's output-token
budget and come back truncated). A batch whose call fails (model unreachable,
timeout, unparseable / structurally-invalid response) falls back to the
heuristic for *that batch's* regions only; other batches keep their LLM
result, so a flaky local model degrades gracefully. See :func:`_llm_emit_plan`
for the request/response contract.

Warnings are emitted to stderr — stdout is reserved for the CLI's JSON
payload contract — and are gated behind a ``verbose`` flag. By default
hybrid mode is silent; pass ``verbose=True`` (set by ``dgml --verbose``
on the CLI) to see the per-page warnings and summary.
