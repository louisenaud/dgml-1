"""LLM-based clustering for very small corpora.

The embedding + statistical-clustering pipeline in
:mod:`dgml_core.run_clustering` is the right tool once a corpus is large
enough for document-frequency statistics and neighborhood graphs to mean
something. On a handful of documents it is not: tf-idf has almost nothing
to weight, k-NN graphs are dominated by noise, and density estimators
collapse everything into one cluster (or all noise). This module is the
small-corpus escape hatch.

Instead of embedding, it reuses the very same vision LLM machinery that
powers ``dgml file add --auto-classify`` (:mod:`dgml_core.classification`)
and asks the model to *partition* the whole corpus in a single call: every
document's rendered first pages are sent at once, each tagged with a stable
``doc_N`` label, and the model returns a set of groups — each either
matching an existing DocSet or proposing a brand-new document type (name,
description, key questions), exactly like the classifier's
``create_new_docset`` tool.

The output contract is deliberately identical to
:func:`dgml_core.run_clustering.run_clustering_detailed` so the two methods
are interchangeable behind :func:`dgml_core.clustering.clustering_internal`:
each file maps to either an *existing DocSet name* (the model judged it
belongs there) or an emergent ``"unknown_N"`` bucket. For the emergent
buckets the model's proposed name/description/key-questions ride along in
:attr:`LLMClusteringResult.proposals`, so the outer clustering flow can
create those DocSets without a second LLM round-trip.

    """Outcome of :func:`llm_cluster_files`.

    ``clusters`` maps each successfully-grouped ``file_id`` to a cluster
    name — either the name of an existing DocSet the model assigned it to,
    or an emergent ``"unknown_N"`` bucket. This mirrors the
    ``{doc_id: cluster_name}`` contract of
    :func:`dgml_core.run_clustering.run_clustering`.

    ``proposals`` carries the model's proposed DocSet metadata for each
    emergent bucket, keyed by the same ``"unknown_N"`` name used in
    ``clusters``. Each value is a ``decision="new"``
    :class:`~dgml_core.classification.ClassificationDecision`, so the outer
    :func:`dgml_core.clustering.clustering` flow can create the DocSet
    directly instead of issuing a second naming call.

    ``confidences`` maps each successfully-grouped ``file_id`` to the
    model's *self-reported* confidence in that grouping, in ``[0, 1]``, or
    ``None`` when the model omitted it for the group. Every file in a group
    inherits the group's reported confidence. This mirrors the ``confidence``
    column the embedding path carries on
    :class:`~dgml_core.run_clustering.DocPrediction`, so the LLM backend stops
    handing downstream consumers a column of ``None``. It is an ordinal
    self-report, not a calibrated probability — a cheap, single-call signal
    (no second partitioning pass); calibration is a heavier, separate layer.

    ``failed_file_ids`` lists files that were not placed in any cluster:
    those with no rendered page image, those over the ``max_files`` cap, and
    any the model omitted from every group.
