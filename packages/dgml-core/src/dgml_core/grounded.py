"""LLM-backed schema generation and grounded value extraction.

This module powers two CLI surfaces:

- ``dgml extraction generate-schema`` — the configured ``schema_model`` is
  given sample PDFs from the docset and asked to propose a *typed field tree*
  describing the structured information to extract, choosing an ``xsd``
  datatype (or enum token set) for each leaf. That tree is rendered straight
  to the at-rest RELAX NG Compact schema
  (:func:`dgml_core.extraction_schema.field_tree_to_rnc`) — no JSON Schema
  intermediate. Downstream extraction attributes every value back to a region
  of the source via the ``extracted_value`` form
  (``{text, value?, locations: [{page_number, bounding_box}]}``).

- ``dgml extraction extract`` (and the auto-extract hook on
  ``dgml docset add-file``) — the configured ``values_model`` is given a PDF
  plus the docset's schema, and asked to produce values matching that schema.
  To keep output attributable to the source, the model is granted a
  ``get_page_words`` tool that returns OCR-extracted words and their bounding
  boxes from the workspace. The model produces final results via a
  ``submit_values`` tool call.

Coordinate space contract:
- Bounding boxes are integer image pixels ``[left, top, right, bottom]``
  (top-left origin) at 300 dpi, relative to ``page_images/page_N.png`` —
  one convention end-to-end. This is what ``page_text/page_N.json``
  stores, what the ``extracted_value`` form uses in schemas and values,
  and what the ``get_page_words`` tool hands the model. The model reads
  pixel word boxes and returns pixel bboxes, so every hop speaks one
  language with no conversion.

DEFAULT_MAX_TOOL_ITERS = 20

# Per-call output token cap — deliberately set to the largest ceiling any
# current frontier model offers (128K on Claude Opus/Sonnet 5, Sonnet 4.6,
# Gemini 2.5 Pro). `llm._build_completion_kwargs` clamps this down to each
# model's documented limit, so a model with a lower ceiling (Haiku 4.5 at
# 64K) gets its own maximum rather than a 400. Asking for the ceiling matters
# for value extraction: a long itemized document can genuinely need
# >65K output tokens, and clipping surfaces as truncated tool-call arguments.
_DEFAULT_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS = 128000

# Temperature for value extraction specifically. Schema generation
# benefits from a little creativity (it's choosing field names);
# value extraction is a faithful mapping of source text → schema
# slots, so we want deterministic, systematic behavior — go through
# the table row by row, not "make a stylistic call about how many
# entries to include". 0 forces greedy decoding.
_DEFAULT_VALUES_TEMPERATURE = 0.0

# Reasoning / "thinking" budget for the models. litellm normalizes
# this across providers — for Gemini it maps to
# thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel, for Anthropic to extended-thinking
# budget, for OpenAI to reasoning_effort. We default to "high"
# because the multi-page array completeness task in particular
# benefits from the model actively reasoning over which pages it
# has and hasn't covered, instead of pattern-matching its way to a
# small answer. Without an explicit value, providers default low
# (Gemini's REST API defaults are notably lower than AI Studio's
# UI defaults, which is the trap we just hit).
_DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT = "high"

# Value extraction is the exception: it runs at "medium". Thinking tokens bill as
# output tokens and output is the bulk of extraction spend, which makes the
# reasoning budget the largest cost and latency dial on this path. Measured
# against reference labels, "medium" cost about a quarter less and finished about
# twice as fast, with extraction quality equivalent to "high" and no document
# losing entries from a repeating field — including the long, table-heavy
# documents the "high" default was originally chosen to protect.
#
# This is deliberately a separate constant rather than a change to
# _DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT. Schema generation and location grounding force
# ``tool_choice``, so the LLM wrapper drops ``reasoning_effort`` for
# Anthropic-routed models and the value would be inert there on Claude — but it
# is NOT dropped for other providers, and lowering their budget was not
# measured. Only phase 1 uses auto tool choice, so only phase 1 changes.
_VALUES_REASONING_EFFORT = "medium"


# HTTP timeout for a single litellm call. The default in litellm is
# in the few-minutes range and isn't long enough for high-reasoning
# extractions on a multi-page document (observed real-world timeouts
# at ~13min on a 7-page ledger with reasoning=high). 30 min gives
# the model room to think through a long table without us cutting
# the connection.
_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 1800

# Default number of files the schema-generation step samples from a
# docset when the caller doesn't specify any. Three is a deliberate
# middle ground — enough variation for the model to spot what generalizes
# across instances of the document kind, few enough to keep cost bounded.

    """Outcome of an extraction call.

    ``values`` is the structured values tree (the in-process form). It is
    persisted as a ``dg:extraction`` element inside the file's core
    ``<stem>.dgml.xml`` at ``xml_path`` (spec §13) — no separate file.
    ``mode`` is ``"full-extraction"`` when the file already had a generated
    document tree (extraction added as a sibling) or ``"extraction"`` when the
    core file was created with only the ``dg:extraction`` element.
    ``tool_calls`` is the count of ``get_page_words`` grounding lookups the
    model performed before finalizing — a rough proxy for how much grounding it
    leaned on.

    """Ask the configured LLM to extract values from a file against a docset's schema.

    Runs in three phases:

    1. **Values + pages (LLM).** The schema is shown with
       ``bounding_box`` stripped from ``grounded_field.locations``. The
       model returns each value as ``{text, locations: [{page_number}]}``.
       Giving the model only "what's the value and which page is it on?"
       lets it cover multi-page arrays reliably — earlier single-pass
       extractions under-counted rows when the same call also had to
       compute bboxes.

    2. **Match in code.** :func:`dgml.matching.run_phase2_matching` walks
       the phase-1 values, looks up each text on its page in
       ``page_text/page_N.json``, and commits unambiguous OCR-word spans
       as bboxes. Free, fast, deterministic. Anything the code can't
       resolve (no match, or ambiguous) falls through.

    3. **Locate the leftovers (LLM, page-by-page).** For each page with
       unresolved items, send the page image + OCR words + the list of
       unresolved ids to the model and ask for an ``id → bbox`` mapping.
       Code patches those bboxes back into the values tree — the model
       never has to echo the whole structure, so phase-3 prompts and
       outputs stay small.

    Cost telemetry (``--debug`` only, via ``debug``): a single
    ``extract_values`` row in ``usage.jsonl`` sums phase 1 + 3 (phase 2 is
    code only). Per-phase timings, costs, and match percentages are also
    written to ``extraction_stats.json`` (unless ``write_stats=False``, which
    the CLI sets unless ``--debug``) so the UX can render them without
    re-deriving anything from the usage log.

    Returns ``(submit_args, tool_calls_run, chunk_calls)`` — ``submit_args``
    carries the merged ``values`` tree plus optional sibling fields like
    ``layout``; ``chunk_calls`` counts the submission calls (1 for the
    ordinary single ``submit_values``, more when the model used the chunked
    protocol). Mutates ``totals`` by adding cost/token deltas from every
    litellm call so the surrounding ``extract_values`` records a single
    usage row across both phases.

    Two submission protocols:

    * **Single-shot** (ordinary documents): one ``submit_values`` call, its
      ``done`` flag omitted or true.
    * **Chunked** (very large outputs): ``submit_values`` with
      ``done: false`` (scalars + first array batches), then repeated
      ``append_entries`` calls extending an array at a dotted path, the
      last one carrying ``done: true``. Each non-terminal call gets an
      acknowledging tool result so the model continues the same turn loop.

    ``chunked`` must match the tool set the caller built (see
    :func:`_phase1_tools`): the chunked protocol is honored only when it is
    set, so an ``append_entries`` call that arrives without it is treated as
    an unknown tool. That keeps the caller's invariant true by construction —
    if appends ran, chunked mode was on, so the payload gets pruned.

    A turn that stops with ``finish_reason == "length"`` raises
    :class:`_OutputTruncated` so the caller can retry with an explicit

    * a leaf with at least one usable location is grounded → computed keys

    * a leaf with computed markers and no usable location is computed →

    The schema we hand to litellm's tool-call parameter spec must be
    self-contained — provider adapters resolve $ref inconsistently and
    relative-path resolution against a sub-schema doesn't always look
    where the operator's schema expects. This walker rewrites every
    ``{"$ref": "#/definitions/X"}`` to the body of ``definitions.X``,
    recursively (so chains of defs collapse), and strips the
    ``definitions`` / ``$schema`` blocks from the resulting schema
    since they're no longer referenced.

    Why also force ``additionalProperties: false``: observed in the
    wild that Gemini's tool-call argument validation accepts extra
    properties even when ``required`` declares specific names (e.g.
    a ``locations[]`` item appearing with ``page_number`` + a fabricated
    ``bounding_2_box`` instead of the required ``bounding_box``).
    Setting ``additionalProperties: false`` on every constrained object
    node closes that hole: any property name not listed in
    ``properties`` is rejected at the API layer. We only set the flag
    when ``properties`` is present and the schema author hasn't already
    specified ``additionalProperties`` — so a deliberately
    open-ended map in the docset schema (rare, but possible) still
    works.

    A ``$ref`` node may carry sidecar keys next to the ref (``prompt``,
    ``example``, ``description``, ``datatype``, ``value_enum`` — the
    per-field annotations the RNC bridge emits). Those are merged onto
    the expanded definition so per-field guidance survives into the tool
    schema; ``value_enum`` is *specialized* into the expanded leaf's
    ``value.enum`` so the provider constrain-decodes the normalized
    value to the schema's closed token set.

    Unknown $ref forms (external URLs, non-``definitions`` JSON Pointers)
