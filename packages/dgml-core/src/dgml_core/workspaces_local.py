"""The bundled :class:`~dgml_core.workspaces_store.WorkspacesStore`: a folder per
workspace on local disk.

``~/dgml-workspaces/<workspace_id>/config.toml``, and that folder is also where the
bundled :class:`~dgml_core.storage_local.LocalStore` puts the workspace's ``files/``
and ``docsets/`` unless its ``[storage]`` table names a ``workspace_path`` elsewhere.
So the zero-config workspace is one obvious, listable, greppable directory::

    ~/dgml-workspaces/
    └── ws_7qx4m2p8k3n5r9t1/
        ├── config.toml
        ├── files/
        └── docsets/

The parent is ``$DGML_WORKSPACES`` when set, else ``~/dgml-workspaces``, else whatever
``[workspaces] root`` says. Not a hidden directory and not under an XDG base dir,
because it holds source documents and page images rather than settings.

Two properties fall out of the folder name *being* the workspace id, and both are the
point rather than a coincidence: there is no index to keep in sync, and a directory
whose name is not a well-formed id is simply not a workspace, so unrelated files
dropped in the parent are ignored rather than half-listed.

This backend detects no write conflicts (see
:meth:`~dgml_core.workspaces_store.WorkspacesStore.write_config`): a local directory has
one writer per machine by construction, so the read-modify-write window is the same one
an ordinary file edit has always had.
