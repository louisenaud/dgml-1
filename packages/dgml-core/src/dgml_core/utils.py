    DGML's output is XML, so a code point XML 1.0 forbids is not a rendering

    raises ``ValueError: All strings must be XML compatible`` the moment such a
    character is assigned to element text or an attribute, which aborts the
    whole ``docset generate`` (an INTERNAL_ERROR, not a per-file failure) and
    loses the documents that had already converted.

    Models do emit them. gpt-5.4-mini transcribed the non-breaking hyphens in a
    clinical-protocol corpus as U+FFFE ("self<FFFE>monitored"), which is a
    noncharacter, and took the docset down with it. Nothing is recoverable from
    such a character — it carries no text — so it is dropped rather than
    substituted: any stand-in would be a guess at what the page really said,
    and would show up as content in a format whose whole claim is that its text
    is the document's text.

    Applied where model output first becomes structured data
    (:func:`dgml_core.generation.blocks.parse_block`), so block text, entity
    span offsets, coverage tokenization, grounding, and the renderer all agree
    on one string. Sanitizing at render time instead would break the renderer's
    invariant that its text is byte-identical to the transcript.

    the view: ``page1`` takes ``pages[0]`` and discards the rest, so only
    ``page_1.json`` is worth fetching. Every other view (``full``, ``headers``,
    ``salient_boost``, or any multi-view spec naming them) reads all pages.

    Two callers materialize page text for that reader — ``_corpus_dir`` for a
    whole corpus, ``_file_text_dir`` for one record — into different directory
    shapes. This is the part they must agree on: narrowing for a view that turns

    truncate it differently. Returning *keys* rather than writing files leaves
    the shape entirely to the caller.
