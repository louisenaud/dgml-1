"""Resolving a workspace's storage backends from configuration.

DGML's store *resolver*, kept separate from the store *abstraction*
(:mod:`dgml_core.storage_service`, the :class:`BlobStore` / :class:`DocStore`
interfaces a third party implements). A workspace has **two** independently
configured backends — a blob store and a document store — so everything here
comes in pairs:

- **Read** — :func:`load_store_configs` resolves a named service's
  ``[storage.<name>.blobs]`` / ``.docs`` templates from the merged ``config.toml``
  into a ``(blob_cfg, doc_cfg)`` pair of :class:`StorageConfig`.
- **Build** — :func:`make_blob_store` / :func:`make_doc_store` resolve a
  ``provider`` dotted path to its interface subclass and construct it.
- **Identify** — :func:`storage_fingerprint` hashes one backend's credential-free
  identity; :func:`storage_fingerprint_pair` seals the two together.
- **Decide** — :func:`resolve_store_configs` picks *which* pair a given workspace
  opens with, and :func:`verify_storage_fingerprint` checks that pair against the
  seal recorded in the workspace's own ``config.toml``.

**Storage is the one config section that does not layer.** Every other section
deep-merges across the five layers in :mod:`dgml_core.config`; a storage service the
workspace defines in its own ``config.toml`` is taken *whole*, so the workspace is
self-describing and its seal cannot be tripped by an edit to the user-level config. A
service the workspace does *not* define falls back to the merged config, which is what
makes ``[storage.<name>]`` templates shared across workspaces still work.
