"""Code-side matching of phase-1 extracted text to OCR word boxes.

Phase 1 of grounded extraction returns ``{text, locations: [{page_number}]}``
for each leaf — the value and which page(s) it lives on, but no bbox. This
module is the first non-LLM pass at assigning bboxes: for each
``(leaf, page)`` pair, find contiguous spans of OCR words on the page whose
joined text matches the value, and commit the match when it's unambiguous.

**Repeated top-level values.** A field outside any array (a patient
name, an order number) is often printed several times on its page — in a
running header, a fax banner, and once in the body. Every occurrence is
the same text, so the row and column passes (which need array peers)
cannot choose, and the value used to go to the paid phase-3 LLM call. A
last-resort pass picks one occurrence when the page gives positive
evidence: the field-name words printed as a label next to exactly one
occurrence, or exactly one occurrence outside the page's header/footer
bands. With no such evidence the value still goes to phase 3. A field
whose only occurrence is already held by another top-level field with
the same text (start date == end date) shares that occurrence.

**Disambiguation by row context.** When a leaf's text has multiple
candidate spans on the page (a date that appears in several columns of a
ledger row, say), look at already-matched siblings in the same direct
parent of the values tree. Sibling bboxes anchor the row's y position;
the only candidate within ~1.5 line heights of that band wins. If the
anchor doesn't single one out, the row anchor falls through to column
anchor.

**Disambiguation by column context.** Same-row collisions (post_date,
due_date and the prefix of created_on all reading "Jun 16, 2025") all
sit on the same y-band so row anchor can't break the tie. The column
pass infers, from peers in the same array, where a given field's column
sits on the x-axis. The inference is alignment-aware: it picks whichever
of {xmin, x_center, xmax} has the tightest spread across resolved peers,
so left-aligned text columns, right-aligned currency columns, and
centered date columns all work without a hint. If no edge clusters
tightly enough, the slot isn't a column and the heuristic declines — a
free-form list of signatures positioned anywhere on the page falls
through to phase 3 untouched.

**Coordinate space.** Bounding boxes are integer image pixels
``[left, top, right, bottom]`` (top-left origin) everywhere they are
*stored* — that is the project-wide convention, the shape OCR words
arrive in from ``page_text/page_N.json`` and the shape this module emits
into ``grounded_field`` locations (see :func:`_span_to_locations`).

The disambiguation heuristics, however, reason in page-relative
normalized 0-1000 units: row-band slack, column-cluster radii, and the
tie-break tolerances are all tuned as fractions of the page so they hold
across page sizes (column anchors in particular aggregate matches across
pages). So whenever a heuristic reads a stored sibling box it normalizes
on the fly via that box's page dims — see :func:`_bbox_norm`. Pixels are
the boundary representation; normalized 0-1000 is the internal scratch
space.

# empirically a column — use its position to pick the right candidate.
#
# Three alignment styles show up in practice and we don't know which a
# given column uses, so the inference picks per-column: whichever of
# ``xmin`` / ``x_center`` / ``xmax`` has the tightest spread across peer
# matches becomes that column's alignment edge. Left-aligned text columns
# share ``xmin``; right-aligned currency columns share ``xmax``; centered
# columns share ``x_center``. Free-form arrays (a signatures list at
# scattered positions) blow past the spread threshold on all three edges
# and the heuristic correctly declines to anchor.


# Threshold for "tight enough to be a column" — about 3% of the

    Column anchors only build for arrays the phase-1 ``layout`` hint
    marks ``kind: "table"``. Layout classification is phase 1's job — it
    sees the page and knows whether an array is a grid. Guessing from

    Why dominant-cluster instead of plain median: when OCR errors push
    a fraction of early phase-2 single-candidate matches to the wrong
