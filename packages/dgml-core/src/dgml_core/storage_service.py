"""Pluggable workspace storage — two independent stores, blobs and documents.

A workspace's data is two unrelated kinds, each with its own small, familiar API
and its own pluggable backend:

- :class:`BlobStore` — opaque bytes (page images, PDFs, XML, schema files),
  modeled on the S3 object API (``put_blob`` / ``get_blob`` / ``list_blobs`` / …),
  plus a concrete path bridge for tools that demand a real filesystem path.
- :class:`DocStore` — JSON documents (manifests, page text, assignments, usage),
  modeled on the MongoDB collection API (``put_doc`` / ``get_doc`` / ``find_docs``
  / …).

The two are configured and resolved **independently**: a workspace can put its
blobs on one backend and its documents on another (e.g. S3 blobs + Mongo docs),
or run both on the bundled :class:`dgml_core.storage_local.LocalStore` — which
implements *both* interfaces over one directory (the zero-config default).

This module is **only the abstraction** — the two interfaces a third party
implements, plus the :class:`StorageConfig` each receives. Turning configuration
into live stores (reading ``[storage.<name>.blobs]`` / ``.docs`` templates,
importing the ``provider`` dotted paths, constructing the stores, and hashing
their identity) is the resolver's job and lives in
:mod:`dgml_core.storage_resolve`.

Writing your own store
----------------------

1. ``pip install dgml`` (the wheel — no repo clone).
2. Subclass :class:`BlobStore` **or** :class:`DocStore` (or both, like
   ``LocalStore``), implementing :meth:`~_StoreBase.parse_config` (call
   :meth:`~_StoreBase._check_no_extra_fields` first), ``__init__`` (lazy SDK
   import — raise an actionable error if a dependency is missing), and that
   interface's methods.
3. Make the class importable by the interpreter running dgml.
4. Point ``config.toml`` at it — ``[storage.<name>.blobs] provider =
   "your_pkg.mod:YourBlobStore"`` and/or ``[storage.<name>.docs] provider = …`` —
   see :func:`dgml_core.storage_resolve.load_store_configs`.

For a :class:`BlobStore`, the path bridge (:meth:`~BlobStore.materialize` and
friends) and :meth:`~BlobStore.sha256_blob` are concrete — you get working
versions from the abstract blob methods and only override them if your backend
can do better.
