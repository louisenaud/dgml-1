"""Digital text extraction from PDFs.

Walks pdfminer.six's page layout, groups characters into whitespace-separated
words, and emits one compact JSON file per page in the file's ``page_text/``
directory. Coordinates are converted from PDF points (origin bottom-left) to
image pixels matching the corresponding ``page_images/page_N.png`` render.

OCR and hybrid extraction live in :mod:`dgml.ocr` and :mod:`dgml.hybrid` and
share the per-page JSON shape emitted here so downstream consumers don't have
to care which mode produced the words.

**Scanned pages.** A page that is a full-page image (see
:data:`RASTER_PAGE_COVERAGE`) with no words, or fewer than
:data:`MIN_SCAN_TEXT_WORDS` (a Bates stamp, a page number), has no text layer
that stands for what is printed on it. Each page is checked as it is extracted
(see :func:`page_text_defect`) and the verdict lands on
:attr:`ExtractDigitalResult.defects`; the words themselves are written as
pdfminer produced them. :func:`dgml_core.ocr.recover_unusable_pages` acts on
the verdict. On the eval corpus (587 PDFs) 674 raster pages have no words and
none has 1-9; the rest carry 18 or more and are not touched. A sparse
*visible* overlay on a scan (a 26-word watermark) is not flagged; ``--text-mode
hybrid`` is the mode that tells that apart from a baked OCR layer.
