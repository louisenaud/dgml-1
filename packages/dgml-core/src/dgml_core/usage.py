"""LLM usage / cost event log.

Every LLM-backed operation (classification, schema generation, value
extraction) appends one JSON line to ``<workspace>/usage.jsonl`` so the
workspace carries a permanent record of what was spent. Records include
the model, token counts, cost in USD (when known), wall time, the
operation outcome, and a small per-operation ``context`` blob
(``file_id``, ``docset_id``, ``tool_calls``, etc.).

The event log is append-only and deliberately permissive: write failures
here MUST NOT break the LLM-using operation that called us, and read
failures (corrupt lines, truncated tail) MUST be tolerated by readers.

Why JSONL instead of a single growing JSON array: appends are O(1) and
crash-safe; a partial line at end-of-file from a crash mid-write is
trivial to skip on read instead of breaking JSON parse for the whole
file.

    genuinely used zero cache, and the values are summed across calls. A
