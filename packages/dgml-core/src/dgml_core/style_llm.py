"""LLM-from-image ``dg:style`` for OCR-mode files.

OCR providers return no font facts, so the deterministic ``dg:style`` path
(pdfminer → ``page_text`` → grounding) produces nothing for ``--text-mode ocr``
files. When a workspace opts in via the ``style`` section of ``config.toml``
(see :mod:`dgml.style_config`), this module fills that gap with a vision model:
each page image is shown to the model alongside the grounded text snippets that
landed on it, and the model returns observed CSS per snippet. Every returned
value is run through :func:`dgml_core.style.validate_style` so only allow-listed
pairs are emitted. Page calls are independent and fan out over a bounded thread
pool; the tree itself is only ever touched by the calling thread.

Off by default and gated (in :func:`dgml_core.xml_grounding.ground_dgml_xml`) on
the file's recorded ``text_mode`` being ``ocr`` — it never competes with the
deterministic digital/hybrid path. Isolated here so the default grounding path
stays free of any LLM dependency.

    takes precedence over — what the model reports. Per-page failures are
    swallowed so one bad page can't abort the rest.

    Pages are fully independent, so their vision calls run concurrently over up
    to ``max_concurrency`` threads (litellm's HTTP call releases the GIL). No
    page's failure ever affects another: :func:`_styles_for_page` returns its
    error rather than raising, so nothing is ever cancelled and every page runs.
    The thread split is strict — workers see only a ``str`` image key, the
    ``BlobStore`` to read it from, and an ``LLMConfig``, and return plain
    data; **every read of and write to the XML tree happens on this thread**, in
    ``by_page`` order, so output is byte-identical whatever the worker count and
    whatever order the calls complete in. Page images are read inside the workers
    rather than prefetched, capping resident image bytes at ``max_concurrency``
    pages instead of the whole document.

    Failed pages are logged at INFO, one line each. A model-unreachability
    failure (bad key, bad model id, dead endpoint) is additionally logged once
    at WARNING rather than once per page, since it recurs identically on all of
    them — and it leaves the whole document unstyled, which the user must hear
    about without asking.

    Each page is one vision call, which records its own ``usage.jsonl`` row
    (labelled ``style_annotate``, gated on ``debug``) from the recording context
    carried on the per-page :class:`~dgml_core.llm.LLMConfig`. Row *order* in
    that log is completion order, not page order. Do not wrap a call to this
    function in :func:`dgml_core.llm.record_usage_for`: ``replace`` would hand
    every page config the same ``_usage_sink`` dict and the concurrent
