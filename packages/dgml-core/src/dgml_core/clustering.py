"""Clustering over unassigned files in a workspace.

Two modes, both driven through the same :func:`clustering` entry point:

- **fresh** — no clusters exist yet (or the caller forces it): every
  unassigned file is clustered from scratch into emergent ``"unknown_N"``
  buckets (scenario S1), which are then LLM-named into new DocSets.
- **incremental** — clusters already exist and a new batch of files has
  arrived (the "S3" workflow). Each existing DocSet becomes a category
  prototype reconstructed from *all* of its already-assigned members'
  embeddings (few-shot / S3). New files are assigned to the nearest
  existing DocSet when they fit, and the leftovers form fresh
  ``"unknown_N"`` clusters that are LLM-named into new DocSets. This
  covers the three incremental cases: everything fits an existing
  cluster, some fit and some form new clusters, or nothing fits.

``mode="auto"`` (the default) picks incremental when the workspace
already has DocSets and fresh otherwise. ``mode="fresh"`` /
``mode="incremental"`` force the respective path; forcing incremental on
a workspace with no DocSets raises :class:`IncrementalWithoutClusters`.

:func:`clustering_internal` invokes ``dgml.run_clustering`` over the
workspace's unassigned files; :func:`clustering` walks the resulting
``file_id → cluster_name`` map and assigns each file to a DocSet, asking
the configured vision LLM (via :func:`propose_new_docset_for_files`) to
name DocSets for unmatched clusters.

    1. Files whose cluster name matches an existing DocSet are assigned
       to that DocSet immediately.
    2. Files whose cluster doesn't match are grouped by cluster name;
       for each unmatched cluster the DocSet to create is named either
       from a proposal the clusterer already produced (the ``llm`` method
       partitions and names in one call) or, failing that, by sending up to

       :func:`propose_new_docset_for_files`. The proposed DocSet is created
       and every file in that cluster is assigned to it.

    ``method`` selects how documents are grouped (orthogonal to ``mode``):
    ``"embedding"`` (default) uses the statistical pipeline; ``"llm"`` uses
    the vision-LLM partitioner built for very small corpora; ``"auto"``
    picks ``"llm"`` when at most ``small_corpus_threshold`` files are
    clusterable, else ``"embedding"``. See :data:`ClusterMethod`.

    Partial success: if classification config is missing/invalid, or the
    LLM call for a given cluster fails, the files in *that* cluster
    land in ``failed_file_ids`` while every other cluster (matched or
    successfully named) is still assigned. Files whose page rendering
    failed at ingest time (no ``page_1.png``) also land in
    ``failed_file_ids``. The function does not raise.

    Returns a JSON-serializable dict. The first three keys are the core
    contract; the rest are **additive** incremental-workflow fields
    (optional — consumers can ignore them):

    - ``clusters``: the ``file_id → docset_name`` map for every file
      whose cluster was successfully assigned. Placeholder labels from
      the algorithm (e.g. ``"unknown_0"``) are rewritten to the actual
      DocSet name the file landed in — either an existing DocSet's
      name or the new name the LLM proposed. Files that failed to
      assign keep their placeholder label here (and also appear in
      ``failed_file_ids``).
    - ``failed_file_ids``: file IDs that were not assigned to any
      DocSet — either because their first-page image was missing or
      because their cluster needed LLM naming and that naming failed
      (missing config, no page images, provider error, …).
    - ``skipped``: ``True`` only when ``skip_existing`` was passed and there
      were no unassigned files (the clusterer never ran); ``False`` on every
      actual clustering run. Always present so callers can read it directly.
    - ``mode``: the effective run mode — ``"fresh"`` or ``"incremental"``
      (``"auto"`` is resolved to one of these before running).
    - ``n_assigned_existing``: number of files assigned to a DocSet that
      already existed before this run (only meaningful for incremental).
    - ``n_new_clusters``: number of *new* DocSets created this run.
    - ``assignments``: ``{file_id: {"docset", "confidence", "review", "is_new"}}``
      for every successfully-assigned file — ``confidence`` is the
      assignment confidence in ``[0, 1]``: the nearest-prototype softmax
      peak (incremental), the unsupervised clustering-geometry score
      (fresh / S1 emergent buckets), or the model's self-report (the ``llm``
      method). It is ``null`` only when the backend produced no score for a
      file. ``review`` is the abstain flag (§4.4): ``True`` when the
      calibration / abstain gate is not confident enough to auto-accept the
      assignment. ``is_new`` flags files that landed in a DocSet created
      this run.
    - ``review_queue``: sorted list of the ``file_id``s whose ``review`` flag
      is set — the documents to route to a human. Empty unless a calibration
      abstain gate or consolidation is configured.

    ``skip_existing`` makes the whole call a no-op (returns ``skipped: True``,
    empty maps) when every file is already assigned — cheap to use on resume.

    ``config`` selects the clustering configuration: ``None`` uses the
    workspace ``config.json`` ``clustering`` section (bundled defaults when
    absent); a preset name (``small`` / ``light`` / ``medium`` / ``heavy``)
    loads a bundled preset; anything else is treated as a path to a standalone
    config JSON. See :func:`resolve_clustering_overrides`.
