"""Clustering over unassigned files in a workspace.

Two modes, both driven through the same :func:`clustering` entry point:

- **fresh** — no clusters exist yet (or the caller forces it): every
  unassigned file is clustered from scratch into emergent ``"unknown_N"``
  buckets (scenario S1), which are then LLM-named into new DocSets.
- **incremental** — clusters already exist and a new batch of files has
  arrived (the "S3" workflow). Each existing DocSet becomes a category
  prototype reconstructed from *all* of its already-assigned members'
  embeddings (few-shot / S3). New files are assigned to the nearest
  existing DocSet when they fit, and the leftovers form fresh
  ``"unknown_N"`` clusters that are LLM-named into new DocSets. This
  covers the three incremental cases: everything fits an existing
  cluster, some fit and some form new clusters, or nothing fits.

``mode="auto"`` (the default) picks incremental when the workspace
already has DocSets and fresh otherwise. ``mode="fresh"`` /
``mode="incremental"`` force the respective path; forcing incremental on
a workspace with no DocSets raises :class:`IncrementalWithoutClusters`.

:func:`clustering_internal` invokes ``dgml.run_clustering`` over the
workspace's unassigned files; :func:`clustering` walks the resulting
``file_id → cluster_name`` map and assigns each file to a DocSet, asking
the configured vision LLM (via :func:`propose_new_docset_for_files`) to
name DocSets for unmatched clusters.

    Calls :func:`clustering_internal` to map each unassigned file to a

    1. Files whose cluster name matches an existing DocSet are assigned
       to that DocSet immediately.
    2. Files whose cluster doesn't match are grouped by cluster name;
       for each unmatched cluster the DocSet to create is named either
       from a proposal the clusterer already produced (the ``llm`` method
       partitions and names in one call) or, failing that, by sending up to
       :data:`MAX_FILES_PER_CLUSTER_NAMING` files to
       :func:`propose_new_docset_for_files`. The proposed DocSet is created
       and every file in that cluster is assigned to it.

    ``method`` selects how documents are grouped (orthogonal to ``mode``):
    ``"embedding"`` (default) uses the statistical pipeline; ``"llm"`` uses
    the vision-LLM partitioner built for very small corpora; ``"auto"``
    picks ``"llm"`` when at most ``small_corpus_threshold`` files are
    clusterable, else ``"embedding"``. See :data:`ClusterMethod`.

    Partial success: if classification config is missing/invalid, or the
    LLM call for a given cluster fails, the files in *that* cluster
    land in ``failed_file_ids`` while every other cluster (matched or
    successfully named) is still assigned. Files whose page rendering
    failed at ingest time (no ``page_1.png``), and files the clusterer
    placed in no cluster at all, also land in ``failed_file_ids``. The
    function does not raise.

    Returns a JSON-serializable dict. The first three keys are the core
    contract; the rest are **additive** incremental-workflow fields
    (optional — consumers can ignore them):

    - ``clusters``: the ``file_id → docset_name`` map for every file
      whose cluster was successfully assigned. Placeholder labels from
      the algorithm (e.g. ``"unknown_0"``) are rewritten to the actual
      DocSet name the file landed in — either an existing DocSet's
      name or the new name the LLM proposed. Files that failed to
      assign keep their placeholder label here (and also appear in
      ``failed_file_ids``) — except files that were never in a cluster to
      begin with (no page image, or the clusterer's noise bucket), which
      are absent from ``clusters`` entirely.
    - ``method``: the engine that grouped the files after ``auto`` was
      resolved — ``"embedding"`` or ``"llm"`` — or ``None`` when no engine ran
      (nothing unassigned, nothing clusterable, or ``skip_existing``
      short-circuited). Never ``"auto"``: that is a request, not an outcome.
    - ``failed_file_ids``: file IDs that were not assigned to any
      DocSet — because their first-page image was missing, because the
      clusterer placed them in no cluster (they resemble neither an
      existing DocSet nor each other), or because their cluster needed
      LLM naming and that naming failed (missing config, no page images,
      provider error, …).
    - ``skipped``: ``True`` only when ``skip_existing`` was passed and there
      were no unassigned files (the clusterer never ran); ``False`` on every
      actual clustering run. Always present so callers can read it directly.
    - ``mode``: the effective run mode — ``"fresh"`` or ``"incremental"``
      (``"auto"`` is resolved to one of these before running).
    - ``n_assigned_existing``: number of files assigned to a DocSet that
      already existed before this run (only meaningful for incremental).
    - ``n_new_clusters``: number of *new* DocSets created this run.
    - ``assignments``:
      ``{file_id: {"docset", "confidence", "is_new", "review"}}``
      for every successfully-assigned file — ``confidence`` is in ``[0, 1]``
      and ``is_new`` flags files that landed in a DocSet created this run.
      What ``confidence`` *means* depends on ``method``. For ``embedding``
      it is the nearest-prototype confidence for files matched against
      existing DocSets, and the clustering-geometry confidence (peak softmax
      over centroid distances) for files placed by a fresh clustering run;
      ``null`` when the clusterer produced no score. For ``llm`` it is the
      model's self-reported confidence in the group the file was put in,
      shared by every member of that group, and ``null`` when the model
      declined to report one. Neither is a calibrated probability — both are
      an ordinal ranking over which assignments to review first, comparable
      within one run only, unless ``clustering.scenario.calibration`` is
      configured.
      ``review`` flags an assignment the run wants a human to confirm. It never
      changes where the file landed: a flagged file is assigned like any other.
    - ``review_queue``: the ``file_id``s whose ``review`` flag is set, as a
      list. Always present, and always empty unless the clustering config sets
      ``scenario.calibration`` (a coverage target or an abstain floor).

    ``skip_existing`` makes the whole call a no-op (returns ``skipped: True``,
    empty maps) when every file is already assigned — cheap to use on resume.

    ``config`` selects the clustering configuration: ``None`` uses the
    workspace ``config.toml`` ``clustering`` section (bundled defaults when
    absent); a preset name (``small`` / ``light`` / ``medium`` / ``heavy``)
    loads a bundled preset; anything else is treated as a path to a standalone
    config JSON. See :func:`resolve_clustering_overrides`.

    ``mode`` selects fresh vs incremental clustering; see the module
    docstring. ``"incremental"`` on a workspace with no DocSets raises
    :class:`IncrementalWithoutClusters`.

    A cluster name is either the name of an existing DocSet (the file is
    judged to belong with that DocSet's existing members) or
    ``"unknown_<n>"`` (a fresh cluster proposed for files that don't fit
    any existing DocSet). Files the clusterer put in *no* cluster don't get
    a name at all — see :attr:`_InternalResult.unclustered` below.

    ``method`` selects the clustering engine (orthogonal to ``mode``):

    - **embedding** ⇒ the statistical pipeline via
      :func:`dgml.run_clustering.run_clustering_detailed`.
    - **llm** ⇒ the vision-LLM partitioner
      (:func:`dgml_core.llm_clustering.llm_cluster_files`), for very small
      corpora. Emergent clusters carry a naming proposal on
      :attr:`_InternalResult.proposals`.
    - **auto** (the default) ⇒ ``llm`` when a *fresh* run has at most
      ``small_corpus_threshold`` clusterable files, else ``embedding``; an
      incremental run always takes ``embedding`` (see :func:`_resolve_method`),
      and so does an ``auto`` run whose classification config cannot be used
      (see :func:`_llm_partitioner_usable`).

    ``mode`` selects fresh vs incremental (see the module docstring):

    - **fresh** ⇒ pure unsupervised S1 over the unassigned files. Existing
      DocSets, if any, are ignored as prototypes.
    - **incremental** ⇒ each existing DocSet is a category whose prototype
      is reconstructed from *all* its members that have a rendered page
      (few-shot S3, or name-only S2 if a DocSet has no usable members).
      Requires at least one DocSet.
    - **auto** ⇒ incremental when DocSets exist, else fresh.

    Two kinds of file come back without a cluster name, and both are
    reported separately from ``clusters`` so the outer :func:`clustering`
    can route them into ``failed_file_ids``:

    - :attr:`_InternalResult.render_skipped` — no first-page image (page
      rendering failed at ingest time), so they were never embedded.
    - :attr:`_InternalResult.unclustered` — embedded, but the clusterer's
      density algorithm assigned them to its noise bucket. They are *not*
      an emergent cluster: they resemble neither an existing DocSet nor
      one another, so naming them into a DocSet would invent a category.

    Returns an :class:`_InternalResult`. Empty workspace ⇒ an empty
    result carrying the resolved ``mode``.

    walking a directory of ``<file_id>/page_text/*.json``

    ``LocalStore`` the workspace ``files/`` dir already is that directory and is
    yielded unchanged. On any other backend nothing is on local disk, and the
    encoder would otherwise raise "found no page_text under …" naming a directory
    that is empty by design — while pointing the user at OCR, which is not the
    problem.

    Only ``page_text`` is materialized. ``files/<id>/`` also holds the source

    ``text_view`` narrows it further — the default view, ``page1``, needs only

    text per record into a different directory shape.

    the encoder's document-frequency thresholds (``min_df``/``max_df``) and its
    "N files but none contain extracted text" message identical across backends.

    The directory lives only for the duration of the ``with`` block; the encoder

    ``proto_docsets`` (empty in fresh mode) are offered to the model as
    existing categories a group may be assigned to; matched files come back
    keyed to the DocSet's name, emergent ones as ``"unknown_N"`` with a
    naming proposal in :attr:`_InternalResult.proposals`.

    A missing/invalid ``classification`` config propagates (it's a setup
    error the caller must fix). A *runtime* LLM failure soft-fails the whole
    batch — every usable file is routed into ``render_skipped`` so the outer
    :func:`clustering` reports them in ``failed_file_ids`` rather than
    crashing, mirroring the embedding path's per-cluster soft-fail.

    Setup problems never reach here under ``auto``: the routing checks for them
    first (:func:`_llm_partitioner_usable`). What it cannot check for is a call
    that fails once started, and ``retry_on_embedding`` says what to do then.
    Set only under ``auto``, it returns ``None`` instead of soft-failing, and
    the caller groups the corpus with the embedding pipeline.

    That is worth doing because some of these failures are the partitioner's
    alone, not the model's. It sends every file's pages in one request under a
    bespoke grouping tool, so it can exceed a provider's per-request image cap,
    or get back members named by filename instead of the ``doc_N`` labels the
    tool defines. The naming pass the embedding path uses has neither problem:
    one small request per cluster, a different tool. So the second engine can
    name a corpus the first one just failed on, and a caller who did not choose
    the first engine should not lose the run to it.
