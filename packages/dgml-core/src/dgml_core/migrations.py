"""Workspace schema migrations — bring an existing workspace up to date.

A workspace records the layout revision it was written against as
``schema_version`` in ``workspace.json``. :func:`migrate_workspace` applies
every registered migration above that number, in order, and stamps the new
version. The CLI runs it once per command, immediately after resolving the
workspace, so an older workspace upgrades itself the first time any command
touches it — there is no ``dgml migrate`` to remember and no flag day.

Design rules for anything added to :data:`_MIGRATIONS`:

- **Idempotent.** Two processes may run the same migration concurrently, and a
  crash must leave a state the next run can finish. Write only what is absent.
- **Additive where possible.** A migration that only adds files can be replayed
  and cannot corrupt a workspace it has already visited.
- **Silent when there is nothing to do.** The common case is a current
  workspace: that path must cost one document read.
- **Store-agnostic in signature.** A migration may target a single backend (the
  first one repairs a layout that only ever existed on local disk) but it must
  no-op cleanly on the others rather than raise.

While the storage layer is still an unmerged branch, **fold new data changes
into migration 1 rather than adding a migration 2**. Users upgrade from
released ``dgml`` straight to the merged result, so no workspace will ever sit
at an intermediate revision, and a chain of migrations mirroring our commit
order would be dead code the day it shipped. Add a new version only for a
change that lands *after* the storage layer is released.

    **Store-free, and deliberately not a** :data:`_MIGRATIONS` **entry.** Migration
    dispatch reads ``workspace.json`` *through the store*, and the store is the very
    thing this repairs — so it cannot be version-dispatched without a chicken-and-egg.
    It is guarded on content instead: a workspace whose config already carries a
    ``storage_fingerprint`` returns immediately. That also makes it correct for a
    workspace a development build already stamped at the current version, which a
    registered migration would silently skip.

    The binding is seeded from the **registry snapshot**, never from the merged config.
    A workspace created with ``--storage svcA`` whose ``[storage.svcA]`` template was
    later edited is pinned by the old resolver to the snapshot; seeding from the
    template instead would silently relocate it to a different backend and orphan its
    data.

    A workspace with no legacy row is already resolving from its ``config.toml``, so
    there is nothing to move — but it is still sealed, so the drift guard covers
    workspaces that predate it rather than leaving them permanently unguarded.

    ``assume_local_when_unbound`` covers the workspace with **no** recorded binding
    anywhere — old enough that the index never carried one, or one whose ``config.toml``
    was deleted. Those two cases are indistinguishable, and in the second the binding is
    unrecoverable regardless, so refusing preserves nothing. It still defaults to
    ``False``: on the per-command path, inventing a local binding would seal the
    workspace to local disk and write the next file there, starting a second corpus while
    reporting success. ``dgml workspace import`` passes ``True``, because a caller
    explicitly adopting a directory needs an outcome they can act on — and it reports the
    assumption rather than making it quietly.

    Idempotent, and safe to interrupt: both writes replace whole tables, so a crash
    between them leaves a workspace that is re-migrated byte-identically. Returns 1
