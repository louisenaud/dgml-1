"""Convert between the at-rest extraction schema (RELAX NG Compact, ``schema.rnc``)
and the internal ``extracted_value`` JSON Schema the extraction engine drives off.

The DGML spec (§12) makes RELAX NG Compact the canonical docset schema. The
grounded-extraction engine in :mod:`dgml_core.grounded`, however, was built
around a JSON Schema whose every leaf is a reusable ``extracted_value``
(verbatim text + optional normalized value + grounded-or-computed provenance).
Rather than rewrite the engine, this module is the deterministic bridge:

    RNC (at rest)  ⇄  Vocabulary (intermediate)  ⇄  extracted_value JSON Schema

The RNC handled here is the constrained subset the spec defines — a namespace
declaration, a ``start`` rule rooted at ``dg:chunk``, and one named pattern per
tag of the form ``Name = element docset:Name { content }`` with
``##`` doc comments; a field's content model is ``text``, an ``xsd:`` datatype,
or a value enumeration (``( "a" | "b" )``). It is **not** a general RELAX NG
implementation; anything outside the subset raises :class:`SchemaInvalid`.
Full RELAX NG (RNG/Jing) validation of instance documents is intentionally out
of scope, so this module pulls in no third-party RELAX NG dependency (keeping
the Apache-2.0 license clean).

# an LLM proposal to the at-rest RNC (:func:`field_tree_to_rnc`): the model
# picks a datatype per leaf, so the vocabulary carries ``value_type`` natively
# and :func:`vocabulary_to_rnc` emits ``xsd:`` typed leaves — no grounded_field
# JSON Schema in between.

# XSD datatypes a leaf may declare. ``text`` (or an omitted datatype) is the
# untyped default. The rest all round-trip through the extraction serializer's
# value normalization (``dgml_core.extraction_xml._typed_value``): ``integer``
# and ``decimal`` get numeric cleanup, the others keep their declared type with
# the value detector's normalized ``dg:value``.

#   nested inside a collection entry therefore cannot reference a sibling
#   collection within that same entry; there is no relative path form.
