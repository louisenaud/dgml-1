"""Page-image deskew for the OCR path.

When an OCR provider reports that a rendered page's content is skewed
(Azure Document Intelligence's ``page.angle``), we rotate the page image
*and* the OCR word boxes by the identical transform so the boxes stay
aligned with the content, and rewrite the deskewed image back to
``page_images/page_N.png`` so every downstream consumer (grounding,
generation's vision transcription, DGMLX export) sees the corrected page.

The image rotation uses Pillow — an optional dependency shipped with the
OCR extras (``pip install dgml[azure]`` / ``dgml[aws]``). If Pillow is not
installed we skip deskew with a warning rather than failing the OCR run.
The box transform is pure ``math`` (no NumPy) so it always runs.

Angle convention: ``angle`` is clockwise-positive, matching Azure DI's
``page.angle`` (the clockwise orientation of the content). Pillow's
``Image.rotate(angle)`` rotates counter-clockwise by ``angle``, which
therefore *undoes* a clockwise skew of ``angle`` degrees. The word-box
transform below is derived to match ``Image.rotate(angle, expand=...)``
exactly, so image and boxes never drift.
