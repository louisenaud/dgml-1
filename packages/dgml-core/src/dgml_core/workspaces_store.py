"""The store of **workspaces** — the list of them, and each one's ``config.toml``.

This completes the family: a :class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.BlobStore` stores
blobs, a :class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.DocStore` stores documents, and a
:class:`WorkspacesStore` stores workspaces. Note the plural — it holds *workspaces*,
not the stores belonging to one workspace.

What it holds per workspace is exactly one thing: the text of that workspace's
``config.toml``. That file is authoritative — it carries the ``[workspace]`` identity
block and the ``[storage.<service>]`` binding — and it is the **bootstrap** artifact,
so it cannot live in the storage it names. Two backends ship: one folder per workspace
on local disk (:mod:`dgml_core.workspaces_local`), and one document per workspace in
MongoDB (``dgml_storage_mongo``), which is what lets two machines share a list.

Only ``config.toml`` text crosses this interface. Nothing here parses a workspace's
settings, opens its stores, or knows what a docset is — a listing row is *derived* from
the text (:meth:`WorkspacesStore.list_entries`), never stored beside it as a second
source of truth. That is the mistake the per-machine JSON index made: columns that
could disagree with the thing they described.

Resolution — which backend a machine uses — lives in
:mod:`dgml_core.workspaces_resolve`, mirroring the
``storage_service`` / ``storage_resolve`` / ``storage_local`` split.

Adding a backend
----------------

Subclass, declare ``name`` and ``config_fields``, and implement the four primitives
(:meth:`~WorkspacesStore.read_config`, :meth:`~WorkspacesStore.write_config`,
:meth:`~WorkspacesStore.list_configs`, :meth:`~WorkspacesStore.delete`) plus
``parse_config`` and ``__init__``. Everything else has a working default. Then name it
by dotted path::

    [workspaces]
    provider = "my_package:MyWorkspacesStore"

Override a default only to avoid work the default would waste: ``exists`` fetches a
whole config to answer a boolean, and ``list_entries`` parses every config to render a
listing — a backend that can project fields server-side should say so.

        ``expected_text`` is what :meth:`read_config` last returned, and the write is
        conditional on the stored text still being exactly that. A backend able to
        detect a mismatch must raise
        :class:`~dgml_core.errors.WorkspacesWriteConflict` rather than overwrite, because
        a lost update over whole-file text discards the other writer's ``[storage]``
        table and comments, not just the field being written. ``None`` means
        unconditional — a fresh workspace, or a backend with one writer by construction.

        The token is the **text itself** rather than a version number because the stored
        text is the only state there is. A counter is a second source of truth to keep in
        step, and it exists only because this interface hands a backend the read and the
        write as separate calls: with both inside one transaction a store could detect the
        conflict itself, whereas comparing content needs nothing a backend is not already
        holding.

        Writing text **identical** to what is stored must succeed rather than conflict —
        there is nothing to lose, and the contract suite pins it.

        *How* a backend decides the stored text still matches is its own business:
        comparing the text, comparing a hash of it, or mapping it back to some private
        version of its own. One comparing content directly also finds that an A→B→A
        sequence does not conflict, which is sound — the stored state is what was read, so
        an edit of that text is what was intended — whereas one tracking its own counter
        will refuse that write. Both are acceptable: a backend may refuse **more** eagerly
        than content comparison would, never less.

        Whatever the mechanism, the comparison must be **byte-exact**. A backend whose
        equality folds case, accents, Unicode normal form or trailing whitespace will judge
        two *different* configs equal and overwrite the other writer — precisely the failure
        this parameter exists to prevent, arrived at silently. That is easy to inherit
        rather than choose: MySQL's default collation (``utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci``) is case- and
        accent-insensitive, Postgres 12+ offers non-deterministic collations, and a MongoDB
        collection can carry a default ``collation``. So pin a byte-comparing collation, or
        compare a hash, or compare bytes — not the engine's default notion of string
        equality. The opposite error is harmless by comparison: judging equal text unequal
        raises a spurious conflict, and the caller re-runs.

        Must be atomic with respect to concurrent readers: a reader sees the old text
        or the new one, never a partial file.
