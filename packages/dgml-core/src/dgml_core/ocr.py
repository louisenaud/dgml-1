"""OCR text extraction — abstract provider interface, config loader, dispatcher.

Loads OCR config from ``<workspace>/config.toml``, dispatches to the
configured provider, and writes the same per-page JSON shape as
:func:`dgml.text_extraction.extract_text_digital` so downstream code
(``dgml check``, consumers) doesn't care which mode produced the text.

The providers DGML bundles live in sibling modules so this file stays
focused on the abstraction:

- :class:`dgml_core.ocr_macos.MacosProvider` — Apple Vision (on-device,
  the zero-config default on macOS)
- :class:`dgml_core.ocr_azure.AzureProvider` — Azure Document Intelligence
- :class:`dgml_core.ocr_aws.AwsProvider` — AWS Textract

They hold no privileged position: each is named by the same dotted path a
third party's own provider would use, and :data:`BUILTIN_OCR_PROVIDERS`
maps the short names (``"aws"``, ``"azure"``, ``"macos"``) onto them as a
convenience so existing configs keep working.

Writing your own provider
-------------------------

1. ``pip install dgml-core`` (the wheel — no repo clone).
2. Subclass :class:`OcrProvider`, implementing :meth:`~OcrProvider.parse_config`
   (call :meth:`~dgml_core.provider.ProviderConfigFields._check_no_extra_fields`
   first), ``__init__`` (lazy SDK import — raise
   :class:`~dgml_core.errors.MissingExtra` if missing), and
   :meth:`~OcrProvider.analyze_image`.
3. Make the class importable by the interpreter running dgml.
4. Point ``ocr.provider`` at it::

       [ocr]
       provider = "your_pkg.mod:YourProvider"
       your_option = "…"

   Fields other than ``provider`` are handed to your ``parse_config`` as
   ``config.options``; declare the ones you accept in ``config_fields``.

Cloud SDKs are **optional** runtime dependencies — install with
``pip install dgml[aws]`` or ``pip install dgml[azure]``. Calling an OCR
path without the matching extra installed raises :class:`OcrFailed` with
an actionable message.
