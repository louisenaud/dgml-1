"""The **legacy** per-machine workspace index — read only, for importing.

``~/.config/dgml/workspaces.json`` used to be how a machine knew which workspaces it
had: a JSON object mapping each ``workspace_id`` to where that workspace was last
seen. It is no longer written, and nothing resolves through it.

What replaced it is :mod:`dgml_core.workspaces_store` — a pluggable store that holds
the list of workspaces *and* each workspace's ``config.toml``. The difference that
matters is authority: this file's rows were a second copy of facts that lived
elsewhere, so they could disagree with the workspace they described and had to be
rewritten on every open to stay current. A listing row now comes out of the
workspace's own config, so there is nothing to keep in sync.

This module survives so ``dgml workspace import`` can read what an older dgml left
behind, and so :func:`dgml_core.migrations.migrate_workspace_config` can still lift a
pre-upgrade row's inline ``storage`` snapshot into the workspace's own config. Both
are read-only. Nothing here writes the file, and once every workspace a machine cares
about has been imported it can be deleted.
