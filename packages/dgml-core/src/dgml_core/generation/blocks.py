"""Typed block model and the deterministic flat→tree builder.

The model never emits a tree. It emits a FLAT sequence of typed blocks —
headings with levels, paragraphs, list items, table rows, form fields — and
the tree (sections, lists, tables, forms) is derived here with plain code.
That single decision is what deletes the seam problem: a flat list has no
open elements, so a window boundary cannot leave anything dangling.
