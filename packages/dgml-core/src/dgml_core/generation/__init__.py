"""PDF→DGML generation: typed-block transcription + batch-wide labeling.

The pipeline has three deterministic-by-construction properties:

1. **Well-formed structure by construction.** The model emits a FLAT list of
   typed JSON blocks per window; nesting is derived deterministically from
   heading levels and block runs (`blocks.build_tree`), so every tree is
   balanced the moment it is built.
2. **Trivial window merging.** Windows are disjoint; a window that starts
   mid-element returns a `continues` string that is appended to the previous
   window's last text block. Merging is list concatenation plus one splice.
3. **Verbatim text.** Semantic labels (concepts) and inline entities (offset
   spans) are assigned in a separate batch-wide labeling pass that sees every
   document at once and never rewrites text. Rendering inserts tags around
   spans; the rendered XML's text is byte-identical to the transcript.
