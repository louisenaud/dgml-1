"""Orchestration: transcribe each document, label the batch, render.

The block contract (flat, typed, verbatim) carries a document end to end:
transcription emits typed blocks per page window, one batch-wide labeling
call assigns concepts across every document at once, and the tree and final
XML are assembled deterministically in plain code. Coverage is measured on
the rendered XML with the ``dgml_core.generation.coverage`` tools.

    Returns ``{name: xml}`` by default. Pass *on_output* — called ``(name, xml)``
    as each document is rendered — to consume each result and have it freed
    immediately (write to disk, score, …) instead of accumulating every
    rendered DGML string in memory; in that case the returned dict is empty.
    (The whole batch's parsed blocks still live in memory for the shared
    labeling pass — that is a separate, inherent floor.)

    Pass *on_error* — called ``(name, message)`` with a short one-line reason —
    to learn *why* a document was dropped during transcription. The full error
    still goes to *options.progress* (the verbose log); this hands the caller a
    compact cause it can put in a machine-readable payload. Called once per
    failed document, serially, after the (possibly concurrent) transcription
    pass — so the callback need not be thread-safe.

    Pass *on_label_error* — called ``(name, {code, message})`` — to learn that a
    document's *labeling* could not reach the model at all (auth, bad model id,
    connection), as distinct from a soft "produced few/no labels" outcome. The
    document still renders (unlabeled), so this lets the caller surface a
    misconfigured ``label_model`` without discarding the transcription. Labeling
    completes before any ``on_output`` fires, so a per-file result built in
    ``on_output`` can read whatever this reported.

    *prior_docs* (already-generated docs from cache) are re-rendered so the
    whole docset stays consistent as its schema/roster grows; any whose render
    changes is re-emitted via *on_output* (skipped if unchanged per
