"""Pass B — semantic labeling with a shared concept roster.

Documents are labeled in bounded chunks (per document, split further when
very large), with the **concept roster accumulated so far** fed into every
subsequent call: "these concepts exist — reuse them verbatim where the role
matches". Cross-document consistency comes from the roster, while each call
stays small enough that the model can label *densely* instead of
cherry-picking a handful of values.

Density contract: every heading block MUST receive a section-role concept;
repeating items/rows/fields receive their shared role; only connective prose may stay
unlabeled. Option I still applies — boilerplate paragraphs with no
queryable role legitimately get nothing — but "skip almost everything" is
not a permitted reading.

Text is never touched; entities are VERBATIM QUOTES of the value, located
in the block's text by the pipeline — the model never counts positions.

    *on_label_error* — called ``(doc_name, {code, message})`` — is invoked once

    *schema_seed* (from a user-supplied ``--schema-path`` or the docset's own

    INSTEAD of the planning call (Pass B.1). This makes the vocabulary
    deterministic and authoritative; per-document labeling still extends it for
    roles the seed does not cover. *roster_seed* is the legacy flat
    ``{concept: description}`` seed (``cache/concept_roster.json``) — same
    semantics, no examples/kind/hierarchy; ignored when *schema_seed* is given.

    *vocab* is the tag vocabulary every model-emitted concept resolves against.
    A CLOSED one makes the seed a contract rather than a suggestion: the prompt
    says the list is exhaustive and the resolver enforces it, so the emitted
    tags are a subset of the supplied names and nothing else. Content is never
    dropped — an unmatched block renders as ``dg:chunk`` with its text intact.
    Default (``None``) is the open vocabulary, i.e. today's coin-freely
    behavior. Deciding WHEN to close is the caller's policy, not this
    function's: the CLI closes on a vocabulary a PERSON authored and not on one
    it derived from its own labels.

    *on_off_schema* — called ``(doc_name, Counter[concept])`` once per document
    that had any — reports the concepts that fell outside an AUTHORED
    vocabulary. Under strict these were refused, and the list says what the
    schema is missing; under extend they were coined and used, and the list is
    the candidate set for the schema's next revision. Either way it is the most
    actionable output of the run.

    Unseeded runs are STAGED: after planning, the largest documents label
    first (a pilot), their observations promote the planned roster to
    confirmed — real examples, observed kinds, tree-derived parents — and the
    rest of the batch labels against that confirmed vocabulary.

    With *cache_dir* set, each call's RAW return is written as
    ``label_<stem>_cNN_raw.json`` and the final concept roster as
    ``concept_roster.json`` — functional files the next run reloads. With
    *debug* additionally set, the per-call input listings
    (``label_<stem>_cNN_input.txt``) and section-retry artifacts are written
    too (debug-only; never read back).
