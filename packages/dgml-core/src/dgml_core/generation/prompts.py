"""Prompt text for the generation pipeline, loaded from ``resources/prompts.yaml``.

Keeping every prompt in one YAML file — rather than inline in the Python
modules — makes the wording easy to read, diff, and tune without touching code.
Use :func:`get` to fetch a prompt by name.

**Variants.** ``prompts.yaml`` may carry an optional ``variants`` block holding
named, partial overrides::

    variants:
      fewshot:
        label_system: |
          ...alternative wording...

Selecting one with ``$DGML_PROMPT_VARIANT`` swaps just those prompts, leaving
the rest at baseline. This exists so prompt wording can be A/B-tested as a
measured axis (the same way the model is) instead of being changed blind: the
benchmark harness runs the same corpus under each variant and compares.

Deliberately strict — an unknown variant name, or a variant that overrides a
prompt that does not exist, raises rather than silently falling back. A run
that quietly ignored the variant it was asked for yields results that look
valid and are not.
