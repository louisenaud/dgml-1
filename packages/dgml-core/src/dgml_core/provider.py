"""Resolving a dotted ``"module.path:ClassName"`` provider string to its class.

DGML lets a third party name an implementation by dotted path in ``config.toml`` —
a workspace's blob store and document store (:mod:`dgml_core.storage_resolve`), the
machine's store of workspaces (:mod:`dgml_core.workspaces_resolve`), and the
workspace's OCR backend (:mod:`dgml_core.ocr`). All of them need the same
import-then-check-the-base-class step, with the same actionable messages, so it lives
here once.

The base-class check is load-bearing beyond catching typos: it is what keeps the
provider namespaces from bleeding into each other. A ``[storage]`` table naming a
:class:`~dgml_core.workspaces_store.WorkspacesStore`, or a ``[workspaces]`` table
naming a :class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.DocStore`, both fail here rather than
half-working.

Deliberately *not* in :mod:`dgml_core.storage_service`, which is documented as
carrying only the abstraction a third party implements — an importer there would
invert that split. Depends on :mod:`dgml_core.errors` alone, so every resolver can
import it without a cycle.

    fields left behind by an older config. Subclasses set ``config_section`` and
    ``config_error`` so the message names the table the user actually wrote and the
