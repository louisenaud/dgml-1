"""A sample :class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.BlobStore`: blobs in S3.

Blobs live in an S3-compatible bucket — the object API ``BlobStore`` was modelled
on, so nearly every method is a one-line delegation. That is the point: a
reference to copy, not a tuned production store. Pair it with a
:class:`~dgml_core.storage_service.DocStore` (e.g. ``dgml-storage-mongo``, or the
bundled local store) for the document half.

**Sample, not supported.** Resolved by dotted path like any third party's own::

    [storage.acme.blobs]
    provider = "dgml_storage_s3:S3BlobStore"
    bucket = "dgml-dev"
    endpoint_url = "http://localhost:9000"   # any S3 server; omit for real AWS S3

    [storage.acme.docs]
    provider = "dgml_storage_mongo:MongoDocStore"
    mongo_database = "dgml_dev"

A local S3-compatible server is not a separate backend — it speaks the S3 API, so
the same class runs against one in dev and against AWS in production by changing
``endpoint_url``. The dev/CI stack runs SeaweedFS (see ``docker-compose.yml``);
nothing in this module knows or cares which server is on the other end.

Credentials
-----------

**Credentials are read from the environment, never from DGML config.** S3 uses
boto3's default chain (``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` / ``~/.aws/credentials`` / an IAM
role). Config carries *identity only* — bucket, endpoint, prefix — which is also
exactly what should define the store fingerprint.

This is not merely stylistic. ``dgml_core.storage_resolve`` excludes secret-hinted
options from a store's identity fingerprint by a **substring match on the option
name** against ``("key", "secret", "token", "password", "credential")``. If you ever
add an inline-credential option, its name must contain one of those substrings — both
so rotating it does not read as "the store moved", and because this config now lives
in the workspace's own plaintext ``config.toml``, which sits beside the workspace and
is likely to be committed or synced.
