"""Active-data "island" detection in an Excel sheet.

An active cell is non-empty, non-whitespace, and not in a hidden row/column.
Cells are grouped by BFS with a connection distance set by ``row_gap`` /
``col_gap`` so that visually separate tables become separate islands (pages).

    asked about, so walking ``1..max_row`` by ``1..max_column`` allocates the
