"""The ``dgmlx://`` URI scheme and on-chain record metadata helpers.

The workspace is local, so an anchored record's URI does not point at a
fetchable location — it encodes *which* workspace objects were attested so a
later proving step can parse them back out::

    dgmlx://<file_id>                     file-side artifacts only
    dgmlx://<file_id>/<docset_id>         docset-scoped (schema + DGML XML)
    dgmlx://<file_id>/<docset_id>#<leaf>  ONE element of the DGML XML
                                          (node-level; <leaf> is the 0-based
                                          Merkle leaf index)

IDs are the dgml CLI's identifiers: lowercase, and drawn from ``[a-z0-9_-]`` — a
generated id is 12 base-36 characters, but a caller can set their own (``file add
--id invoice-2024-q1``), so ``-`` and ``_`` appear here too. This module is the
single source of truth for the scheme and the record-metadata shape; both the
staking and proving halves import it so they cannot drift.
